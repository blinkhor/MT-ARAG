      "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often associated with intellectual disability (ID). ASD-specific group concepts usually focus on people on a high functioning level. The Autism-Competence-Group (AutCom) combines a psycho-educative approach with music and dance/movement interventions in adults with ASD and ID. AutCom includes 16 structured 90-minute sessions to foster social and emotional competencies. This study investigates the acceptability and effectiveness of AutCom. Practicability and acceptability were measured based on participation frequency and patient satisfaction (CSQ-8). Efficacy was assessed in a pre-post design (N = 12) based on self- and third-party assessment with a control group matched by gender and level of ID. Primary outcome variables were social and emotional competence, and secondary outcomes were challenging behavior and quality of life. A participation rate of 86% indicated practicability; high CSQ-8 scores (M = 30 of max. 32) indicated acceptability. Significant improvement was found in social competence compared to the control group and emotional competence in the pre-post self-assessment on the AutCom questionnaire. No significant improvement was found in challenging behavior and quality of life. AutCom is shown to be a promising and highly accepted group concept in fostering social and emotional skills in adults with ASD and ID. ",
      "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of improvisational music therapy on joint attention behaviors in pre-school children with autism. It was a randomized controlled study employing a single subject comparison design in two different conditions, improvisational music therapy and play sessions with toys, and using standardized tools and DVD analysis of sessions to evaluate behavioral changes in children with autism. The overall results indicated that improvisational music therapy was more effective at facilitating joint attention behaviors and non-verbal social communication skills in children than play. Session analysis showed significantly more and lengthier events of eye contact and turn-taking in improvisational music therapy than play sessions. The implications of these findings are discussed further.",
      "Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) using a traditional and a technological intervention (elastic touch-display) in improving the coordination of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as a primary outcome, and the timing and strength control of their movements as secondary outcomes. Methods: Twenty-two children with ASD completed 8 NMT sessions, as a part of a 2-month intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to either use an elastic touch-display (experimental group) or tambourines (control group). We conducted pre- and post- assessment evaluations, including the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ) and motor assessments related to the control of strength and timing of movements. Outcomes and results: All participants improved their coordination, according to the DCDQ scores, and exhibited better control of their movements according to the strength and timing assessments after the intervention. Participants who used the elastic touch-display scored higher on the DCDQ. Conclusions and implications: NMT is an efficacious treatment to improve the coordination skills of children with ASD. Elastic touch-displays provide more benefits than the use of tambourines.",
      "Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by significant impairment in social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviour or interest. Intervention during early childhood could decrease ASD symptoms. We aimed to identify the most effective intervention based on cognitive, developmental, and behavioural approaches and the factors that impact the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing interventions for ASD in preschool-aged children. Electronic databases were searched for related articles with randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs published between 2001 to 2015. Outcome measures were communication, behavioural and cognitive skills, reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) compared to a control group. A Random-effects model was utilised to calculate the pooled estimate effect. Between-study variability was also assessed. The registering number of this study is CRD42017035354. Findings: Out of the initial 5174 studies that were identified, there were 14 RCTs (746 children) that were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled estimate effect provided by random-effects model was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.08-0.37]) with no between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0.00%, p = 0.0018). Three studies of music therapy interventions provided the greatest outcome effects with a shorter duration and lower intensity. SMD for music therapies ranged from 0.40 to 0.62 with 95% CI [0.22 to 1.85]. The quality of the health care provider, the duration, and the intensity of intervention played an important role in the effectiveness of the intervention. Interpretation: Music therapy appears to be an effective tool for improving social interaction in preschool-aged children with ASD. However, more evidence-based trials are required to further validate the effectiveness of music therapy in ASD.",
      "The specific aims of this research study were to (a) examine the differential effect of three different music interventions, namely the interactive music playing therapy ('music and singing'), interaction music singing therapy ('singing'), and receptive music therapy ('listening') studying the varying latency periods in the response time it took 3-year-old children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to elicit the target word vocally; and (b) assess the index of happiness of children with ASD after the implementation of the three music interventions, which can, in turn, be used to influence their overall quality of life through this specific intervention. This study used a combined single-subject research design consisting of delayed multiple baseline across the participants and a multielement design to compare the effects of each music intervention technique targeting the child's verbal response during playback of a practiced song. Findings demonstrated 'singing' to be associated with the lowest latency compared to the other two interventions ('listening' and 'singing and music') across participants. Additionally, happiness levels varied from neutral to happy, signifying an overall positive experience during participation in the music applied behavior analysis (ABA) intervention."

      "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, affecting millions of older people worldwide. However, pharmacological therapies have not achieved desirable clinical efficacy in the past decades. Non-pharmacological therapies have been receiving increased attention to treat dementia in recent years. Objective: This study explores the effects of music therapy on cognitive function and mental wellbeing of patients with AD. Methods: A total number of 298 AD patients with mild, moderate, or severe dementia participated in the study. The participants with each grade of severity were randomly divided into three groups, which were a singing group, a lyric reading group, and a control group. These three groups received different interventions for three months. All participants underwent a series of tests on cognitive functions, neuropsychological symptoms, and activities of daily living at baseline, three months, and six months. Results: The analysis shows that music therapy is more effective for improving verbal fluency and for alleviating the psychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress than lyrics reading in patients with AD. Stratified analysis shows that music therapy is effective for enhancing memory and language ability in patients with mild AD and reducing the psychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress in patients with moderate or severe AD. However, no significant effect was found for activities of daily living in patients with mild, moderate, or severe AD. Conclusion: This study suggests that music therapy is effective in enhancing cognitive function and mental wellbeing and can be recommended as an alternative approach to manage AD associated symptoms.",
      "Background: Music therapy is a potential non-pharmacological treatment for the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, but although some studies have found it to be helpful, most are small and uncontrolled. Methods: This case-control study was carried out by qualified music therapists in two nursing homes and two psychogeriatric wards. The participants were 38 patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) assigned randomly to a music therapy group and a control group. Results: The study showed a significant reduction in activity disturbances in the music therapy group during a 6-week period measured with the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD). There was also a significant reduction in the sum of scores of activity disturbances, aggressiveness and anxiety. Other symptoms rated by subscales of the BEHAVE-AD did not decrease significantly. Four weeks later the effects had mostly disappeared. Conclusions: Music therapy is a safe and effective method for treating agitation and anxiety in moderately severe and severe AD. This is in line with the results of some non-controlled studies on music therapy in dementia.",
      "Background/aims: Numerous studies have indicated the value of music therapy in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease. A recent pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of a new music therapy technique. The aim of this controlled, randomised study was to assess the effects of this new music therapy technique on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer-type dementia. Methods: This was a single-centre, comparative, controlled, randomised study, with blinded assessment of its results. The duration of follow-up was 24 weeks. The treated group (n = 15) participated in weekly sessions of individual, receptive music therapy. The musical style of the session was chosen by the patient. The validated 'U' technique was employed. The control group (n = 15) participated under the same conditions in reading sessions. The principal endpoint, measured at weeks 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24, was the level of anxiety (Hamilton Scale). Changes in the depression score (Geriatric Depression Scale) were also analyzed as a secondary endpoint. Results: Significant improvements in anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.01) were observed in the music therapy group as from week 4 and until week 16. The effect of music therapy was sustained for up to 8 weeks after the discontinuation of sessions between weeks 16 and 24 (p < 0.01). Conclusion: These results confirm the valuable effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. This new music therapy technique is simple to implement and can easily be integrated in a multidisciplinary programme for the management of Alzheimer's disease.",
      "Numerous neuropsychological studies have investigated the effect of music on patients with Alzheimer's disease. Findings suggest that music can improve behavioral symptoms, but its potential effects on cognitive abilities of patients still require more investigation. In this 2 × 2 crossover study, we measured the impact of learning an individualized song on autobiographical memory recall and other cognitive abilities in 12 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. For each patient, one favorite song of the patient and one autobiographical memory with positive valence were associated to create a new personalized song. This song was taught to the patient by a speech and language therapy student throughout 10 sessions. This training period and a non-training period were proposed in a counterbalanced order between participants. We tested participants' autobiographical recall and general cognitive abilities at three time points: at the start of the experiment, at crossover, and at the end of the experiment. After excluding one outlier, results showed a significant improvement in the retrieval of the autobiographical memory and in general cognitive abilities after song training compared to the non-training period. Overall, our findings suggest that the use of personalized songs may be a useful and motivating tool for addressing the decline of autobiographical memory and of cognitive functions in general in persons with Alzheimer's disease.",
      "Background/aims: To investigate the effect of singing training on the cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Methods: Ten AD patients (mean age 78.1 years) participated in music therapy using singing training once a week for 6 months (music therapy group). Each session was performed with professional musicians using karaoke and a unique voice training method (the YUBA Method). Before and after the intervention period, each patient was assessed by neuropsychological batteries, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while the patients sang familiar songs with a karaoke device. As the control group, another 10 AD patients were recruited (mean age 77.0 years), and neuropsychological assessments were performed twice with an interval of 6 months. Results: In the music therapy group, the time for completion of the Japanese Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices was significantly reduced (p = 0.026), and the results obtained from interviewing the patients' caregivers revealed a significant decrease in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (p = 0.042) and a prolongation of the patients' sleep time (p = 0.039). The fMRI study revealed increased activity in the right angular gyrus and the left lingual gyrus in the before-minus-after subtraction analysis of the music therapy intervention. Conclusion: Music therapy intervention using singing training may be useful for dementia patients by improving the neural efficacy of cognitive processing."

      "Objective: Music-supported therapy (MST) is a new approach for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that MST improved the motor functions of post-stroke patients. However, the underlying mechanism for this effect is still unclear. It may result from repeated practice or repeated practice combined with musical stimulation. Currently, few studies have been designed to clarify this discrepancy. In this study, the application of 'mute' musical instruments allowed for the study of music as an independent factor. Methods: Thirty-three post-stroke patients with no substantial previous musical training were included. Participants were assigned to either audible music group (MG) or mute music group (CG), permitting observation of music's independent effect. All subjects received the conventional rehabilitation treatments. Patients in MG (n = 15) received 20 extra sessions of audible musical instrument training over 4 weeks. Patients in CG (n = 18) received 'mute' musical instrument training of the same protocol as that of MG. Wolf motor function test (WMFT) and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for upper limbs were utilised to evaluate motor functions of patients in both groups before and after the treatment. Three patients in CG dropped out. Results: All participants in both groups showed significant improvements in motor functions of upper limbs after 4 weeks' treatment. However, significant differences in the WMFT were found between the two groups (WMFT-quality: P = 0.025; WMFT-time: P = 0.037), but not in the FMA (P = 0.448). In short, all participants showed significant improvement after 4 weeks' treatment, but subjects in MG demonstrated greater improvement than those in CG. Discussion: This study supports that MST, when combined with conventional treatment, is effective for the recovery of motor skills in post-stroke patients. Additionally, it suggests that apart from the repetitive practices of MST, music may play a unique role in improving upper-limb motor function for post-stroke patients.",
      "The use of functional music in gait training termed rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and treadmill training (TT) have both been shown to be effective in stroke patients (SP). The combination of RAS and treadmill training (RAS-TT) has not been clinically evaluated to date. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of RAS-TT on functional gait in SP. The protocol followed the design of an explorative study with a rater-blinded three arm prospective randomized controlled parallel group design. Forty-five independently walking SP with a hemiparesis of the lower limb or an unsafe and asymmetrical walking pattern were recruited. RAS-TT was carried out over 4 weeks with TT and neurodevelopmental treatment based on Bobath approach (NDT) serving as control interventions. For RAS-TT functional music was adjusted individually while walking on the treadmill. Pre and post-assessments consisted of the fast gait speed test (FGS), a gait analysis with the locometre (LOC), 3 min walking time test (3MWT), and an instrumental evaluation of balance (IEB). Raters were blinded to group assignments. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with affiliated measures from pre-assessment and time between stroke and start of study as covariates. Thirty-five participants (mean age 63.6 ± 8.6 years, mean time between stroke and start of study 42.1 ± 23.7 days) completed the study (11 RAS-TT, 13 TT, 11 NDT). Significant group differences occurred in the FGS for adjusted post-measures in gait velocity [F (2, 34) = 3.864, p = 0.032; partial η2 = 0.205] and cadence [F (2, 34) = 7.656, p = 0.002; partial η2 = 0.338]. Group contrasts showed significantly higher values for RAS-TT. Stride length results did not vary between the groups. LOC, 3MWT, and IEB did not indicate group differences. One patient was withdrawn from TT because of pain in one arm. The study provides first evidence for a higher efficacy of RAS-TT in comparison to the standard approaches TT and NDT in restoring functional gait in SP. The results support the implementation of functional music in neurological gait rehabilitation and its use in combination with treadmill training.

      "Individuals with chronic stroke have limited options for hand rehabilitation at home. Here, we sought to determine the feasibility and efficacy of home-based MusicGlove therapy. Seventeen participants with moderate hand impairment in the chronic phase of stroke were randomized to 3 wk of home-based exercise with either the MusicGlove or conventional tabletop exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Box and Blocks test score from baseline to 1 mo posttreatment. Both groups significantly improved their Box and Blocks test score, but no significant difference was found between groups. The MusicGlove group did exhibit significantly greater improvements than the conventional exercise group in motor activity log quality of movement and amount of use scores 1 mo posttherapy (p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively). Participants significantly increased their use of MusicGlove over time, completing 466 gripping movements per day on average at study end. MusicGlove therapy was not superior to conventional tabletop exercises for the primary end point but was nevertheless feasible and led to a significantly greater increase in self-reported functional use and quality of movement of the impaired hand than conventional home exercises.

      "Objective: Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) belongs to neurologic music therapy, which has attracted clinical attention because of its efficacy in motor function after stroke. This study aimed to summarize the effectiveness of rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) for the treatment of motor function and balance ability in stroke through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: All studies were retrieved from six databases. The effects of RAS on stroke were determined using the following indicators: motor function including step length, step cadence, velocity, Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA); and balance ability including overall balance index (OBI) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The risk map of bias of the quality of the studies and the meta-analysis results of the indicators was prepared using RevMan 5.2 software. Results: A total of 1,363 abstracts were retrieved. Among them, 325 duplicate studies were eliminated, and 971 studies were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts. In addition, by downloading the full text for further reading and screening, 47 studies were excluded. A total of 22 studies were included in the systematic review, and 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Assessment of quality, based on the PEDro scale, two studies had low quality, three studies had excellent quality, and the other studies had good quality; based on the Cochrane Collaborative Network Bias Risk Assessment Scale. A total of 15 studies specifically explained the random methods used. Meanwhile, seven studies did not report random sequence generation. A total of 10 studies reported that the evaluation of experimental results was blinded. In the meta-analysis, the results of motor function [namely, velocity (SMD = 0.99, 95% CI (0.43, 1.55)), step length (SMD = 0.97, 95% CI (0.74, 1.20)), and step cadence (MD = 5.16, 95% CI (4.17, 6.14)), FMA (MD = 2.93, 95% CI (2.04, 3.83))], were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The results of balance ability [OBI (MD = -0.51, 95% CI (-0.86, -0.16)) and BBS (MD = 2.93, 95% CI (1.67, 4.20))], were also statistically significant (P < 0.01). Among all the outcome indicators, three indicators were included in more than 10 studies: these are step length, step cadence, and velocity. The results showed that the two sides of the funnel chart were asymmetrical, thus these results all showed heterogeneity. The GRADEpro GDT online tool was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for the outcome indicators in the included studies. Five outcome indicators were included, of which three were low-quality indicators and two were moderate-quality indicators. Conclusions: RAS could improve gait parameters, walking function, and balance ability of individuals with stroke. However, studies or samples of outcome indicators for balance ability of stroke patients is relatively insufficient, which also requires further research in the future. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021225102.",
      "Background: Given the increasing evidence demonstrating the effects of rhythmic auditory cueing for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients, this synthesized analysis is needed in order to improve rehabilitative practice and maximize clinical effectiveness. Objective: This study aimed to systematically analyze the literature on rhythmic auditory cueing for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients by highlighting the outcome variables, type of cueing, and stage of stroke. Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled or clinically controlled trials was conducted. Electronic databases and music therapy journals were searched for studies including stroke, the use of rhythmic auditory cueing, and motor outcomes, such as gait and upper-extremity function. Results: A total of 10 studies (RCT or CCT) with 356 individuals were included for meta-analysis. There were large effect sizes (Hedges's g = 0.984 for walking velocity; Hedges's g = 0.840 for cadence; Hedges's g = 0.760 for stride length; and Hedges's g = 0.456 for Fugl-Meyer test scores) in the use of rhythmic auditory cueing. Additional subgroup analysis demonstrated that although the type of rhythmic cueing and stage of stroke did not lead to statistically substantial group differences, the effect sizes and heterogeneity values in each subgroup implied possible differences in treatment effect. Conclusions: This study corroborates the beneficial effects of rhythmic auditory cueing, supporting its expanded application to broadened areas of rehabilitation for stroke patients. Also, it suggests the future investigation of the differential outcomes depending on how rhythmic auditory cueing is provided in terms of type and intensity implemented."

      "Background: Breast cancer is the most familiar cancer and the major cause of the cancer death in women worldwide. The breast cancer patients may suffer from severe mental and physical trauma. At present, there are few studies on the music therapy for patients with breast cancer. The objective of our paper is to assess the effect of music intervention on mental and physical state of breast cancer patients. Methods: The experiment will be implemented from June 2021 to June 2022 at Jinan Central Hospital. The experiment was granted through the Research Ethics Committee of Jinan Central Hospital (no.08847765). The inclusion criteria requires that the age of female patients ranges from 25 to 65 years old, and the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer requires radical mastectomy (containing extensive radical mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy). Patients who do not like to listen to music or have severe debilitating diseases or are allergic to the sound will be excluded. Patients in the intervention group are given music intervention, and in control group, patients do not receive any information about the music therapy in the period of this study. The primary outcome is quality of life, psychological distress. The secondary outcomes are the heart rate, blood pressure, as well as Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

      "Purpose: Chemotherapy induces a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including pain, sleep disorders, fatigue, and anxiety. We aimed to assess the efficacy of six-step music therapy in relieving pain and anxiety and improving sleep quality in lung cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods: Between March 2013 and October 2015, we enrolled a total of 100 patients who were diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and scheduled for platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the music therapy group (received six-step music therapy, n=50) and the control group (not received six-step music therapy, n=50). The anxiety, pain, and sleep quality of all patients were assessed using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Results: There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics and music background between the two groups. The SAS and VAS scores in the two groups were not statistically different before chemotherapy. However, patients in the music therapy group showed significantly lower SAS and VAS scores compared with the control group at both 1 day and 5 days after chemotherapy. (SAS score at 1-day post-therapy, 49.48±2.14 vs 61.46±8.8, P=0.011; SAS score at 5-day post-therapy, 39.73±1.79 vs 62.02±8.83, P=0.005; VAS score at 1-day post-therapy, 2.14±0.78 vs 4.74±1.01, P=0.005; VAS score at 5-day post-therapy, 2.06±0.79 vs 4.74±1.08, P=0.004). In addition, the total PSQI score of patients who received music therapy was also significantly higher than that of the control group after therapy (total PSQI score at 1-day post-therapy, 8.50±1.69 vs 17.81±3.01, P=0.006; total PSQI score at 5-day post-chemotherapy, 9.84±3.02 vs 18.66±2.91, P=0.012).

      "Introduction: To investigate the effect of perioperative aromatherapy (AT) or/plus music therapy (MT) on pain and anxiety level, and the potential mechanism in women experiencing breast cancer surgery. Methods: A total of 160 patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive usual care (UC), AT, MT, or combination therapy (CT) during perioperative periods. Pain intensity and anxiety scores were measured by visual analog scale. Interleukin (IL)-6 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: There was a significant group effect on pain, anxiety, and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, with the greatest improvement occurring in the CT group (P < .001). Compared with the UC group, the AT and MT groups had lower mean changes of pain intensity and IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels, and greater anxiety reduction (P < .001). However, the differences between the AT and MT groups did not reach significance (P > .05). Conclusion: In patients with breast cancer, perioperative CT achieves greater pain improvement and anxiety reduction and less marked increase in IL-6 and HMGB-1 levels. These results suggest that CT is an acceptable complementary and alternative medicine for breast cancer patients.",
      "Background: Breast cancer remains the most important cancer among women worldwide. The disease itself and treatment may have a profound impact on the patients' psychological well being and quality of life. Depression is common in breast cancer patients and affects the therapeutic effects as well as prolongs the duration of hospital stay. However, few studies reported the effectiveness of music therapy on depression and duration of hospital stay of female patients with breast cancer after radical mastectomy. Methods: One hundred and twenty subjects were recruited to this clinical trial and randomly allocated to two groups. The experimental group (n = 60) received music therapy on the basis of routine nursing care, whereas the control group (n = 60) only received the routine nursing care. The whole intervention time was from the first day after radical mastectomy to the third time of admission to hospital for chemotherapy. Data of demographic characteristics and depression were collected by using the General Questionnaire and Chinese version of Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) respectively. One pre-test (the day before radical mastectomy) and three post-tests (the day before discharge from hospital, the second and third admission to hospital for chemotherapy) were utilized. Duration of hospital stay was calculated from the first day after radical mastectomy to the day of discharged from hospital. Results: The mean depression score of all subjects was 37.19 ± 6.30. Thirty-six cases (30%) suffered from depression symptoms, with 26 (72.2%) mild depression cases, 9 (25.0%) moderate depression cases, and 1 (2.8%) severe depression case. After music therapy, depression scores of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group in the three post-tests, with significant differences (F = 39.13, P < 0.001; F = 82.09, P < 0.001). Duration of hospital stay after radical mastectomy of the experimental group ((13.62 ± 2.04) days) was shorter than that of the control group ((15.53 ± 2.75) days) with significant difference (t = -4.34, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Music therapy has positive effects on improving depression of female patients with breast cancer, and duration of hospital stay after radical mastectomy can be reduced. It is worthy of applying music therapy as an alternative way of nursing intervention in clinical nursing process of caring female patients with breast cancer."

Design and setting: Randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized into two groups. Subjects in the pharmacotherapy group received a therapy with antidepressant drugs; the exercise/music therapy group was assigned to receive physical exercise training combined with listening to music. The effects of interventions were assessed by differences in changes in mood state between the two groups. Main outcome measures: Medically eligible patients were screened with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and with the Geriatric Depression Scale. We used plasmatic cytokine dosage as a stress marker. Results: We recruited 24 subjects (mean age: 75.5 ± 7.4, 11 M/13 F). In the pharmacotherapy group there was a significant improvement in anxiety only (p<0.05) at 6-months. In the exercise/music therapy was a reduction in anxiety and in depression at 3-months and at 6-months (p<0.05). We noted an average reduction of the level of TNF-a from 57.67 (± 39.37) pg/ml to 35.80 (± 26.18) pg/ml. Conclusions: Our training may potentially play a role in the treatment of subjects with mild to moderate depression. Further research should be carried out to obtain more evidence on effects of physical training and music therapy in depressed subjects.",
      "Background: Music therapy has previously been found to be effective in the treatment of depression but the studies have been methodologically insufficient and lacking in clarity about the clinical model employed. Aims To determine the efficacy of music therapy added to standard care compared with standard care only in the treatment of depression among working-age people. Method: Participants (n = 79) with an ICD-10 diagnosis of depression were randomised to receive individual music therapy plus standard care (20 bi-weekly sessions) or standard care only, and followed up at baseline, at 3 months (after intervention) and at 6 months. Clinical measures included depression, anxiety, general functioning, quality of life and alexithymia. Trial registration: ISRCTN84185937. Results: Participants receiving music therapy plus standard care showed greater improvement than those receiving standard care only in depression symptoms (mean difference 4.65, 95% CI 0.59 to 8.70), anxiety symptoms (1.82, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.55) and general functioning (-4.58, 95% CI -8.93 to -0.24) at 3-month follow-up. The response rate was significantly higher for the music therapy plus standard care group than for the standard care only group (odds ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.01 to 9.02). Conclusions: Individual music therapy combined with standard care is effective for depression among working-age people with depression. The results of this study along with the previous research indicate that music therapy with its specific qualities is a valuable enhancement to established treatment practices.",
      "Objective: To test whether group music therapy is effective for improving depression, anxiety, and relationships in psychiatric patients. Methods: Twenty six patients were non-randomly allocated to either a music intervention group or a routine care group. The music intervention group received 60 minutes of music intervention for 15 sessions (1 or 2 times weekly). The outcomes were measured with Beck's Depression Inventory, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Relationship Change Scale. Results: After 15 sessions, the music intervention group showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and relationships compared with the control group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that music can improve depression, anxiety, and relationships in psychiatric patients. However, we cannot elucidate the nonspecific effects. Furthermore, objective and replicable measures are required from a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size and an active comparable control.",
      "Introduction: The sources of stress involved in chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to depressive states, directly affecting the hemodialysis patient's quality of life (QOL). There are few reports and studies on therapeutic interventions that aim to minimize depressive symptoms in these patients and an even greater shortage of studies using music therapy. Objective: This study evaluated the effect of music therapy on QOL and depressive symptoms in hemodialysis patients. Method: This was a music therapy intervention study in which 23 patients were evaluated regarding QOL and depression symptoms at two distinct stages - before and after the intervention. Eight sessions of music therapy were conducted, with two weekly sessions and an average duration of 75 minutes. The intervention was conducted by the music therapist herself, using specific music therapy techniques, besides voice and guitar to conduct harmonic and rhythmic support for the groups' sound-music production. Results: The patients showed a significant reduction in depression symptoms (p < 0.001) and better QOL results, with significant differences in the following dimensions: functional capacity (p = 0.011), pain (p = 0.036), general health (p = 0.01), vitality (p = 0.004), mental health (p = 0.012), symptom and problem list (p = 0.01), and overall health (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Intervention with music therapy constitutes an effective option in the treatment and prevention of depressive symptoms and improved QOL of HD patients.",
      "Purpose: This study aims to identify the effects of relaxation exercises and music therapy on the psychological symptoms and depression levels of patients with chronic schizophrenia. Materials and methods: This semi-experimental study was conducted using pre- and post-tests with a control group. The study population consists of patients with schizophrenia who regularly attended community mental health centers in the Malatya and Elazığ provinces of Turkey between May 2015 and September 2015. The study's sample consists of 70 patients with schizophrenia (n=35 in the control group; n=35 in the experimental group) who were selected randomly based on power analysis. The 'Patient Information Form,' the 'Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)' and the 'Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS)' were used for data collection. Patients in the experimental group participated in relaxation exercises and music therapy 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The experimental group of 35 persons was divided into three groups of approximately 10-12 individuals in order to enable all participants to attend the program. No intervention was applied to the patients in the control group. The data were evaluated using percentage distribution, arithmetic means, standard deviations, Chi-square and independent samples t-tests. Results: The study found that patients in the experimental group showed a decrease in total mean scores on the BPRS and CDSS; the difference between the post-test scores of the experimental group and the post-test scores of the control group was statistically significant (p<0.05). The practice of relaxation exercises and music therapy was proven to be effective in reducing schizophrenic patients' psychological symptoms and levels of depression. Conclusion: Relaxation exercises and music therapy can be used as a complementary therapy in the medical treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia.",
      "Objectives: To examine the effects of a group music therapy on psychiatric symptoms and depression for patient with schizophrenia in a psychiatric nursing home. Subjects and methods: Eighty patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to a music intervention group (MIG) or usual care group (UCG). Both groups received similar medical and routine care. The MIG received a 60-min group music therapy twice a week, a total of ten sessions. The UAG only received the usual care with no music therapy. Psychiatric symptoms and depression assessments were conducted using the positive and negative syndrome scale and the depression scale for schizophrenia at baseline, the posttest, and at a 3-month follow-up. Results: Thirty-eight patients in the MIG and 42 in the UCG completed the study. After 10 sessions of group music therapy, the groups showed statistically significant differences in psychiatric symptoms (p<.05) and depression status (p<.05). Conclusion: Group music therapy is an economical and easily implemented method of improving depression and psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.",
      "Background: The clinical application of music therapy and research into its use and effectiveness are common in Western countries. The physiological role of this type of therapy is to stimulate the central nervous system through music, which may have a sedative, analgesic effect, and reduce negative emotions. Previous studies have confirmed that music can be effective for a range of psychological disorders, including post-stroke depression (PSD). There is, however, a lack of systematic evaluation of its effectiveness, and variability in sample size and in the quality of research has detracted from the persuasiveness of findings. Methods: Based on PRISMA 2020, articles on music therapy intervention in post-stroke depression were identified through the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Weipu, and Wanfang databases. The retrieval time was taken from the establishment of the database to October 18, 2022. Two researchers conducted a stringent evaluation of the quality of the articles and extracted the data. They then used RevMan5.3 software for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty articles were listed, involving 1625 patients. Meta-analysis results showed that music therapy could lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS/Ham-D), the National Institutes of Health stroke scale and self-rated depression scale for patients with PSD. Music therapy was also shown to improve the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living and treatment efficacy of PSD patients. However, music therapy did not reduce the incidence of adverse reactions in PSD patients. Conclusion: Music therapy has benefits in improving HDRS/Ham-D score and symptoms of PSD patients, and could be more widely applied."

      "Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of music therapy as an alternative treatment on depression in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by activating serotonin (5-HT) and improving stress coping ability. Methods: This study is designed based on randomization method. A total of 36 subjects participated in the experiment, consisting of an ADHD control group (n = 18) and ADHD music therapy group (n = 18). The ADHD control group received standard care, while the ADHD music therapy group received music therapy and standard care. The ADHD music therapy group received both active music therapy (improvisation) and receptive music therapy (music listening) for 50 minutes, twice a week, for 3 months: a total of 24 times. From a neurophysiological perspective, changes in depression and stress were tracked by measuring 5-HT secretion, cortisol expression, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and CDI and DHQ psychological scales. Results: The ADHD music therapy group's 5-HT secretion increased (p < 0.001), whereas cortisol expression (p < 0.001), BP (p < 0.001) and HR (p < 0.001) decreased. The CDI and DHQ psychological scales also showed positive changes (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, the ADHD Con G's (who did not receive music therapy) 5-HT secretion did not increase, whereas cortisol expression, BP, and HR did not decrease. In addition, the CDI and DHQ psychological scales did not display positive changes. Conclusions: In conclusion, the application of music therapy as an alternative treatment for ADHD children and adolescents showed positive neurophysiological and psychological effects. Therefore, this study would like to propose a new alternative to medicine for preventing and treating depression through various uses of music therapy.",

      "Objectives: Not all patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) respond to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Literature suggests group music therapy might be beneficial in treating PTSD. However, feasibility and effectiveness have not been assessed. The study objectives were to assess whether group music therapy was feasible for patients who did not respond to CBT, and whether it has an effect on PTSD symptoms and depression. Design: The study employed mixed methods comprising of an exploratory randomized controlled trial, qualitative content analysis of therapy, and patient interviews. Method: Patients with significant PTSD symptoms (n = 17) following completion of CBT were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 9) or control groups (n = 8). The treatment group received 10 weeks of group music therapy after which exit interviews were conducted. Control group patients were offered the intervention at the end of the study. Symptoms were assessed on the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and Beck Depression Inventory II at the beginning and end of treatment. Results: Treatment-group patients experienced a significant reduction in severity of PTSD symptoms (-20.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-31.23, -9.12]) and a marginally significant reduction in depression (-11.92; 95%CI: [-24.05, 0.21]) at 10 weeks from baseline compared to the control. Patients viewed music therapy as helpful and reported experiences concur with current literature. Conclusions: Group music therapy appears feasible and effective for PTSD patients who have not sufficiently responded to CBT. Limitations include the small sample size and lack of blinding. Further research should address these limitations, test sustainability, and identify specific factors that address symptoms in treatment.",

      "Background: Music therapy, as a non-drug therapy, is widely used in patients with COPD. However, the effects of music therapy on dyspnea, anxiety, depression and other physiological parameters has not been elucidated. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of passive music therapy (listening to music) and mixed music (combination of listening and singing) in adults with COPD. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Wanfang Data up to June 26, 2019. All randomized controlled trials that compared music with usual care or other non-musical types of intervention in subjects with COPD were included in the study. The risk of bias for randomized controlled trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Outcomes included dyspnea, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and quality of life, as well as physiological parameters (eg, blood pressure and breathing frequency). Results: After initial screening of 216 potentially relevant records, 59 studies were eligible, and 12 studies with 812 participates met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. Analysis showed that music therapy had a significant effect in relieving dyspnea (mean difference: -0.69, 95% CI -0.80 to -0.58, P < .001) and anxiety (standardized mean difference: -1.87, 95% CI -2.72 to -1.02, P < .001) in adults with COPD. Compared with the control group, music had no statistically significant effect on depression or St George Respiratory Questionnaire score. However, when it came to improving sleep quality, music reduced the total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (P < .001). In addition, the pooled results showed that there was a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure (mean difference: -7.45, 95% CI -10.95 to -3.96, P < .001) and diastolic blood pressure (mean difference: -4.07, 95% CI -7.03 to -1.12, P = .007) in the music group compared to the control. Conclusions: Music therapy is effective in reducing dyspnea and anxiety in subjects with COPD. Additionally, music therapy may also improve sleep quality and physiological parameters of subjects with COPD. However, our conclusions need to be supported further by larger and longer well-designed trials.",
      "[Purpose] We aimed to analyze parameters of pulmonary function and physiological, psychological, and physical factors in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and music therapy (MT). [Participants and Methods] This randomized crossover comparative study included in-patients diagnosed with COPD and a ratio of forced expiratory volume measured at the first second and forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of <70% after administration of a bronchodilator. Patients were randomly divided into two groups that received either PR only or MT and PR (n=13 each). The PR program included conditioning, respiratory muscle training, and endurance training, whereas the MT program included vocal, singing, and breathing exercises using a keyboard harmonica. The programs lasted 8 weeks, in which pre- and post-intervention data were compared every 4 weeks. [Results] The FEV1/FVC in the MT group improved after the intervention. Expiratory volume control was obtained better with feedback by sound than with expiration practice. In the MT and PR program, it was easier to adjust the timing and volume of breathing, obtain expiratory volume control, and, thus, improve FEV1/FVC than in conventional practice. [Conclusion] Combining MT with PR improves parameters of pulmonary function in patients with COPD. Music therapy is a novel approach that, in combination with PR, may be used in COPD management.",
      "Pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a multidisciplinary approach of exercise and pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing. Pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing reduces alveolar collapse during exhalation, and diaphragmatic breathing improves inspiratory pressures. Harmonica playing has maneuvers similar to those taught in pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing, with diaphragmatic breathing to create musical tones. Hence, we designed a trial to determine whether patients with COPD would benefit from harmonica playing. COPD patients who completed pulmonary rehabilitation at least 6 months prior were eligible for this trial. Patients attended 12 weeks of harmonica training sessions for 2 hours a week and were encouraged to practice at home. Participants completed pre- and postspirometry testing, maximum inspired and expired pressure (PImax, PEmax) testing, and 6-minute walk tests. Eleven of the 14 participants completed the 12-week trial. PImax and PEmax increased by an average of 15.4 ± 12.0 cm H2O (P = 0.0017) and 14.4 ± 14.0 cm H2O (P = 0.0061), respectively. Additionally, 6-minute walk distance increased by approximately 60 m (61 ± 78, P = 0.03). This pilot study showed that a 12-week harmonica program significantly improved PImax, PEmax, and 6-minute walk distance in COPD patients after rehabilitation. Larger-scale harmonica studies are warranted to evaluate this program's adjunctive potential benefit to formal pulmonary rehabilitation.",
      "The aim of this randomized control study is to examine the effect of a multimodal psycho-music therapy intervention on respiratory symptoms, psychological well-being and quality of life of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and other lung diseases as adjunct to Pulmonary Rehabilitation with a design of music therapy plus PR compared to Pulmonary Rehabilitation alone. Music therapy group treatment including music visualization, wind playing and singing was provided weekly. This was compared with standard care treatment. Adults ages 48 to 88 (mean 70.1) with moderate to severe GOLD stage II-IV lung disease as well as other diseases processes that lead to chronic airflow limitations were included (n = 98). Participants in both conditions were followed from baseline enrollment to six weeks post control/treatment. Outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory Scale 2nd edition-Fast Screen (BDI-FS), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire Self-Reported (CRQ-SR), and Dyspnea Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Results showed improvement in symptoms of depression (LS mean -0.2) in the music therapy group with statistical divergence between groups (p = 0.007). The CRQ-SR demonstrated improvement in dyspnea (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.5) and mastery (p = 0.06 LS mean 0.5) in the music therapy group and fatigue (p = 0.01 LS mean 0.3). VAS demonstrated highly significant effect in the music therapy group between weeks 5 and 6 (p < 0.001). The findings of this study suggest that music therapy combined with standard PR may prove to be an effective modality in the management of pulmonary disease."

      "Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the music therapy (MT) effect in levels of intraoperative anxiety in patients undergoing crossectomy with stripping of the great saphenous vein and to assess the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of this alternative therapy as a complement of standard intraoperative care. Material and methods: The study is a simple blind, controlled, parallel groups, prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients were allocated by means of randomized controlled sampling. The study was performed in the surgery room of Getafe University Hospital in Madrid. The study was carried out in 40 patients, 20 randomized to the experimental group and 20 randomized to the control group, with an age range from 27 to 70 years. The control group was given intraoperative routine attention, and the experimental group was given an MT passive intervention that consisted of audition of musical fragments during varicose veins surgery. These pieces previously showed relaxing actions on the cardiovascular system. The anxiety levels were measured by means of pre- and postsurgical questionnaires by a blinded investigator for the study arm to which the patients had been randomized. Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were determined during the intervention, and adrenaline and noradrenaline plasma levels were determined before and after the surgical procedure. Results: The majority of the patients in the MT group (95%) and standard care group (90%) completed the study. There were no statistical differences between the control and experimental groups in heart rate gradient or systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured after the intervention. The anxiety state and the stress feeling scale score after surgery were significantly inferior in the MT group (94.7% vs 57.9% decrease in anxiety levels, P < .05, and stress score of 1.31 vs 2.36, P < .05, respectively). The adverse events ratio was low and occurred with similar frequency in both groups. Conclusions: The MT intervention was easily implemented in the context of nursing care received during varicose vein surgery and was positively accepted and valued by the majority of the patients. MT is a safe procedure that is proved to reduce anxiety and stress in the study patients.",
      "Objective: To investigate the effect of music therapy on chronic pain, quality of life, and quality of sleep in adolescent patients after transthoracic occlusion of ventricular septal defects. Methods: Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether they received music therapy: a control group and a music group. The music group received 30 minutes of music therapy every day for 6 months after surgery. Patients in the control group received standard treatment and had 30 minutes of quiet time every day for 6 months after surgery. The short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ), the SF-36 scale and the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (KSQ) was used as the evaluation tool for chronic pain, quality of life, and quality of sleep, respectively. Results: In terms of the degree of postoperative chronic pain, the Pain Rating Index (PRI) emotion item score in the SF-MPQ evaluation of the music group was significantly lower than that of the control group (1.6 ± 1.1 versus 2.2 ± 0.9). The role emotional (RE) scores of the SF-36 in the music group were significantly higher than that in the control group (77.35 ± 18.55 versus 42.66 ± 22.63). KSQ scores were significantly higher in the music group than in the control group for sleep status (4.1 ± 1.0 versus 3.3 ± 0.9), falling asleep (3.9 ± 1.1 versus 3.1 ± 1.0), and not feeling refreshed by sleep (3.6 ± 1.3 versus 2.7 ± 0.9) (P < .05). Conclusion: This study preliminarily showed that music therapy could effectively reduce patients' chronic pain and improve quality of life and sleep after surgery. These results suggest that music therapy may be an essential therapy worth considering in managing patients' postoperative recovery after cardiovascular surgery.",
      "Background: Five-phase music therapy was reported to be effective in the treatment and rehabilitation of several diseases. This study explored the effect of phase I cardiac rehabilitation combined with 5-phase music in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods: This prospective pilot study enrolled AMI patients who received percutaneous coronary intervention from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from July 2018 to December 2019. The participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the control, cardiac rehabilitation, and rehabilitation-music groups. The primary endpoint was the hospital anxiety and depression scale. The secondary endpoints were the myocardial infarction dimensional assessment scale, self-rating sleep status, 6-minute walk test, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Results: The study included 150 AMI patients (n = 50/group). Hospital anxiety and depression scale showed significant time effects for both anxiety and depression (both P < .05), a treatment effect for depression (P = .02), and an interaction effect for anxiety (P = .02).

      "Twelve older adults with cognitive impairments who were participants in weekly community-based group music therapy sessions, 6 older adults in an Alzheimer's caregivers' group, and 6 college student volunteers listened to a 3.5 minute prepared audiotape of instrumental excerpts of patriotic selections. The tape consisted of 7 excerpts ranging from 18 s to 34 s in duration. Each music excerpt was followed by a 7-9 s period of silence, a 'wait' excerpt. Listeners were instructed to move a Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI) to the name of the music excerpt depicted on the CRDI overlay when they heard a music excerpt. Likewise, they were instructed to move the dial to the word 'WAIT' when there was no music. They were also instructed to maintain the dial position for the duration of each music or silence excerpt. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences between the caregivers' and the college students' group means for total dial changes, correct and incorrect recognitions, correct and incorrect responses to silence excerpts, and reaction times. The mean scores of these 2 groups were combined and compared with the mean scores of the group of elderly adults with cognitive impairments. The mean total dial changes were significantly lower for the listeners with cognitive impairments, resulting in significant differences in all of the other response categories except incorrect recognitions. In addition, their mean absence of response to silence excerpts was significantly higher than their mean absence of responding to music excerpts. Their mean reaction time was significantly slower than the comparison group's reaction time. To evaluate training effects, 10 of the original 12 music therapy participants repeated the listening task with assistance from the therapist (treatment) immediately following the first listening (baseline). A week later the order was reversed for the 2 listening trials. Statistical and graphic analysis of responses between first and second baseline responses indicate significant improvement in responses to silence and music excerpts over the 2 sessions. Applications of the findings to music listening interventions for maintaining attention, eliciting social interaction between clients or caregivers and their patients, and evaluating this population's affective responses to music are discussed.",
      "Objective: Music therapy is an innovative approach to support people with severe mental illness (SMI). The aim of the study was to determine whether group music therapy (GMT) positively impacted on quality of life (QoL), social enrichment, self-esteem, spirituality and psychiatric symptoms of participants with SMI and how they experienced the intervention. Method: The primary outcome was QoL; secondary measures assessed social enrichment, self-esteem, spirituality and psychiatric symptoms. The 13-week intervention comprised singing familiar songs and composing original songs recorded in a professional studio. Qualitative data were generated from focus group interviews and song lyric analysis. Results: Ninety-nine adults (57 female) were recruited, with an initial cohort (n = 75) randomized to either: weekly GMT followed by standard care (SC) or SC followed by GMT. Crossover occurred after 13 weeks. Measures were conducted at baseline, 13, 26 and 39 weeks. A second cohort (n = 24) could not be randomized and were assigned to GMT followed by SC. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant difference between GMT and SC on QoL and spirituality. This was robust to different assumptions about missing data (listwise deletion, last observation carried forward or multiple imputation). Per-protocol analysis suggested greater benefit for those receiving more sessions. Focus group interview and song lyric analyses suggested that GMT was enjoyable; self-esteem was enhanced; participants appreciated therapists and peers; and although challenges were experienced, the programme was recommended to others. Conclusion: Group music therapy may enhance QoL and spirituality of persons with SMI.",

Results: After 15 sessions, the music intervention group showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and relationships compared with the control group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that music can improve depression, anxiety, and relationships in psychiatric patients. However, we cannot elucidate the nonspecific effects. Furthermore, objective and replicable measures are required from a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size and an active comparable control.",
      "Aims and objectives: To (1) perform a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials pertaining to the efficacy of music therapy on disruptive behaviours, anxiety levels, depressive moods and cognitive functioning in people with dementia; and (2) clarify which interventions, therapists and participant characteristics exerted higher and more prominent effects. Background: Present study was the first to perform a meta-analysis that included all the randomised controlled trials found in literature relating to music therapy for people with dementia over the past 15 years. Design: A meta-analysis study design. Methods: Quantitative studies were retrieved from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library Database, CINAHL, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. A meta-analysis was used to calculate the overall effect sizes of music therapy on outcome indicators. Results: Music therapy significantly improved disruptive behaviours [Hedges' g = -0·66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0·44 to -0·88] and anxiety levels (Hedges' g = -0·51; 95% CI = -0·02 to -1·00) in people with dementia. Music therapy might affect depressive moods (Hedges' g = -0·39; 95% CI = 0·01 to -0·78), and cognitive functioning (Hedges' g = 0·19; 95% CI = 0·45 to -0·08). Conclusion: Music therapy exerted a moderately large effect on disruptive behaviours of people with dementia, a moderate effect on anxiety levels and depressive moods, and a small effect on cognitive functioning. Relevance to clinical practice: Individual music therapy provided once a week to patients with cognitive functioning and manual guided in music intervention construction is suggested. Group music therapy is provided several times a week to reduce their disruptive behaviours, anxiety levels and depressive moods. Music therapy is a cost-effective, enjoyable, noninvasive therapy and could be useful for clinical nurses in creating an environment that is conducive to the well-being of patients with dementia."

      "Background: Music therapy may provide a means of improving mental health among people with schizophrenia, but its effects in acute psychoses have not been explored. Aims: To examine the feasibility of a randomised trial of music therapy for inpatients with schizophrenia, and explore its effects on mental health. Method: Up to 12 weeks of individual music therapy plus standard care were compared with standard care alone. Masked assessments of mental health, global functioning and satisfaction with care were conducted at 3 months. Results: Of 115 eligible patients 81 (70%) were randomised. Two-thirds of those randomised to music therapy attended at least four sessions (median attendance, eight sessions). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a trend towards improved symptom scores among those randomised to music therapy, especially in general symptoms of schizophrenia. Conclusions: A randomised trial of music therapy for in-patients with schizophrenia is feasible. The effects and cost-effectiveness of music therapy for acute psychosis should be further explored in an explanatory randomised trial.",
      "Pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes a multidisciplinary approach of exercise and pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing. Pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing reduces alveolar collapse during exhalation, and diaphragmatic breathing improves inspiratory pressures. Harmonica playing has maneuvers similar to those taught in pursed-lip diaphragmatic breathing, with diaphragmatic breathing to create musical tones. Hence, we designed a trial to determine whether patients with COPD would benefit from harmonica playing. COPD patients who completed pulmonary rehabilitation at least 6 months prior were eligible for this trial. Patients attended 12 weeks of harmonica training sessions for 2 hours a week and were encouraged to practice at home. Participants completed pre- and postspirometry testing, maximum inspired and expired pressure (PImax, PEmax) testing, and 6-minute walk tests. Eleven of the 14 participants completed the 12-week trial. PImax and PEmax increased by an average of 15.4 ± 12.0 cm H2O (P = 0.0017) and 14.4 ± 14.0 cm H2O (P = 0.0061), respectively. Additionally, 6-minute walk distance increased by approximately 60 m (61 ± 78, P = 0.03). This pilot study showed that a 12-week harmonica program significantly improved PImax, PEmax, and 6-minute walk distance in COPD patients after rehabilitation. Larger-scale harmonica studies are warranted to evaluate this program's adjunctive potential benefit to formal pulmonary rehabilitation.",
      "Introduction: A previous study (carried out in 2003-2004) had included 34 patients with traumatic brain injury in order to study the feasibility and usefulness of music therapy in patients with this type of injury. Objective: To evaluate the effect of music therapy on mood, anxiety and depression in institutionalised patients with traumatic brain injury. Study methodology: A prospective, observational study. Materials and methods: Thirteen patients with traumatic brain injury were included in the present study and took part in individual, weekly, 1-hour music therapy sessions over a period of 20 weeks. Each session was divided into two 30-minute periods - one devoted to listening to music (receptive music therapy) and the other to playing an instrument (active music therapy). The assessment criteria (measured at weeks 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20) were mood (on the face scale) and anxiety-depression (on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression [HAD] Scale). Mood was assessed immediately before and after the first music therapy session and every fifth session. Results: Music therapy enabled a significant improvement in mood, from the first session onwards. This short-term effect was confirmed by the immediate changes in the scores after music therapy sessions (from 4.6+/-3.2 to 2.6+/-2; p<0.01). Music therapy also led to a significant reduction in anxiety-depression (p<0.05) from week 10 onwards and up until the end of the study (week 20). Conclusion: These results confirm the usefulness of music therapy in the treatment of anxiety-depression and mood in patients with traumatic brain injury. Music therapy could usefully form an integral part of the management programme for these patients.",
      "Objective: Schizophrenia is one of the most serious mental disorders. Music therapy has only recently been introduced as a form of treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of music therapy for schizophrenic in-patients needing acute care. Method: Thirty-seven patients with psychotic disorders were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Both groups received medication and treatment indicated for their disorder. Additionally, the experimental group (n = 21) underwent group music therapy. Results: Significant effects of music therapy are found in patients' self-evaluation of their psychosocial orientation and for negative symptoms. No differences were found in the quality of life. Conclusion: Musical activity diminishes negative symptoms and improves interpersonal contact. These positive effects of music therapy could increase the patient's abilities to adapt to the social environment in the community after discharge from the hospital."

      "Background/aims: To investigate the effect of singing training on the cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Methods: Ten AD patients (mean age 78.1 years) participated in music therapy using singing training once a week for 6 months (music therapy group). Each session was performed with professional musicians using karaoke and a unique voice training method (the YUBA Method). Before and after the intervention period, each patient was assessed by neuropsychological batteries, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while the patients sang familiar songs with a karaoke device. As the control group, another 10 AD patients were recruited (mean age 77.0 years), and neuropsychological assessments were performed twice with an interval of 6 months. Results: In the music therapy group, the time for completion of the Japanese Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices was significantly reduced (p = 0.026), and the results obtained from interviewing the patients' caregivers revealed a significant decrease in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (p = 0.042) and a prolongation of the patients' sleep time (p = 0.039). The fMRI study revealed increased activity in the right angular gyrus and the left lingual gyrus in the before-minus-after subtraction analysis of the music therapy intervention. Conclusion: Music therapy intervention using singing training may be useful for dementia patients by improving the neural efficacy of cognitive processing.",
      "Music has been proven to have therapeutic potential in neurological disorders, especially Parkinson's disease (PD), since rhythmic auditory cueing can partially replace the progressive loss of rhythmicity and automaticity. Several reports have highlighted improvements in motor outcomes in PD patients undergoing music therapy, but only a few studies have evaluated non-motor outcomes, such as quality of life (QoL), which deteriorates with disease progression. The current pilot study aims to examine the effects of a multimodal rehabilitation program centered on physical therapy combined with listening to music on self-reported QoL in people with PD, compared to the same rehabilitation program alone. The study was conducted on patients with idiopathic PD who attended a specific rehabilitation program with a duration of 2.5 h daily for 14 days. The patients were divided into the study group (16 patients), who listened to background music during the rehabilitation program sessions, and the control group who did not listen to music during sessions. The patients were assessed using the self-report Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) at the beginning of the program and 1 month after its initiation. The patients in the study group registered greater improvements in five of the eight areas of life assessed by PDQ-39 compared to the control group. In conclusion, listening to music combined with a multimodal rehabilitation program centered on physical therapy may be beneficial for the patients' quality of life.",
      "Objective: Notched music therapy has been suggested to be effective for relieving tinnitus. We have developed a smartphone application using tailor-made notched music for tinnitus patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this smartphone application on reducing tinnitus. In addition, we investigated the predictive factors for tinnitus treatment outcome using this smartphone application. Methods: A total of 26 patients who were chronically distressed by tinnitus with a ≥18 Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score were recruited from March 2013 to March 2015 (National Clinical Trial (NCT) Identifier Number 01663467). Patients were instructed to listen to tailor-made notched music through our smartphone application for 30-60min per day and were prescribed Ginkgo biloba for 3 months. Treatment outcome was evaluated using the THI, a visual analogue scale that measures the effects of tinnitus in terms of loudness, noticeable time, annoyance, and disruption of daily life. Demographic data, including age, sex, duration of tinnitus, and pre-treatment scores on questionnaires such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were compared between the effective and non-effective groups according to the differences between their pre- and post-treatment THI scores. Results: Smartphone application-delivered notched music therapy and Ginko combined treatment improved the THI score from 33.9±18.9 to 23.1±15.2; the effect was particularly marked for the emotional score of the THI. Improvement in the THI score was positively correlated with the initial THI score (P=0.001, adjusted estimated value=0.49, 95% confidence interval=0.25-0.73). Conclusion: Chronic tinnitus patients who underwent smartphone application-delivered notched music therapy and Ginko combined treatment showed improved THI scores, particularly the emotional score of the THI. A smartphone application-delivered therapy and Ginko combined treatment may be more effective in tinnitus patients who have had a higher initial THI.",
      "Background: Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound without external acoustic stimulation. Recent tinnitus research suggests a relationship between attention processes and tinnitus-related distress. It has been found that too much focus on tinnitus comes at the expense of the visual domain. The angular gyrus (AG) seems to play a crucial role in switching attention to the most salient stimulus. This study aims to evaluate the involvement of the AG during visual attention tasks in tinnitus sufferers treated with Heidelberg Neuro-Music Therapy (HNMT), an intervention that has been shown to reduce tinnitus-related distress. Methods: Thirty-three patients with chronic tinnitus, 45 patients with recent-onset tinnitus, and 35 healthy controls were tested. A fraction of these (21/21/22) were treated with the 'compact' version of the HNMT lasting 1 week with intense treatments, while non-treated participants were included as passive controls. Visual attention was evaluated during functional Magnet-Resonance Imaging (fMRI) by a visual Continous Performance Task (CPT) using letter-based alarm cues ('O' and 'X') appearing in a sequence of neutral letters, 'A' through 'H.' Participants were instructed to respond via button press only if the letter 'O' was followed by the letter 'X' (GO condition), but not to respond if a neutral letter appeared instead (NOGO condition). All participants underwent two fMRI sessions, before and after a 1-week study period. Results: The CPT results revealed a relationship between error rates and tinnitus duration at baseline whereby the occurrence of erroneous 'GO omissions' and the reaction time increased with tinnitus duration. Patients with chronic tinnitus who were treated with HNMT had decreasing error rates (fewer GO omissions) compared to treated recent-onset patients. fMRI analyses confirmed greater activation of the AG during CPT in chronic patients after HNMT treatment compared to treated recent-onset patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that HNMT treatment helps shift the attention from the auditory phantom percept toward visual cues in chronic tinnitus patients and that this shift in attention may involve the AG."

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating music-listening for pain management on adults was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses statement. The databases Pubmed, Scopus, SCIELO, SpringerLink, Global Health Library, Cochrane, EMBASE, and LILACS were searched. Studies published between 2004 and 2017 with quantified measurements of pain were included. Quality was evaluated using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodology checklist for RCT, and effect sizes were reported with standardized mean differences. Results: A total of 85 studies were included for qualitative analysis but only 56.47% described at least one music characteristic. Overall meta-analysis found a significant effect, with high heterogeneity, of music for pain management (SMD -0.59, I2 = 85%). Only instrumentation characteristics (lack of lyrics, of percussion or of nature sounds), and 60-80 bpm tempo were described sufficiently for analysis. All three instrumentation characteristics had significant effects, but only the lack of lyrics showed an acceptable heterogeneity. Conclusions: Results show that music without lyrics is effective for the management of pain. Due to insufficient data, no ideal music characteristics for the management of pain were identified suggesting that music, as an intervention, needs standardization through an objective language such as that of music theory.",
      "External cues improve walking by evoking internal rhythm formation related to gait in the brain in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examined the usefulness of using a portable gait rhythmogram (PGR) in music therapy on PD-related gait disturbance. A total of 19 subjects with PD who exhibited gait disturbance were evaluated for gait speed and step length during a 10 m straight walking task. Moreover, acceleration, cadence, and trajectory of the center of the body were estimated using a PGR. Walking tasks were created while incorporating music intervention that gradually increased in tempo from 90 to 120 beats per minute (BPM). We then evaluated whether immediate improvement in gait could be recognized even without music after walking tasks by comparing pre- (pre-MT) and post-music therapy (post-MT) values. Post-MT gait showed significant improvement in acceleration, gait speed, cadence, and step length. During transitions throughout the walking tasks, acceleration, gait speed, cadence, and step length gradually increased in tasks with music. With regard to the trajectory of the center of the body, we recognized a reduction in post-MT medio-lateral amplitude. Music therapy immediately improved gait disturbance in patients with PD, and the effectiveness was objectively shown using PGR."

This study evaluates the impact of MT on anxiety and distress during simulation in patients with newly diagnosed head and neck or breast cancer. Methods and materials: This institutional review board-approved randomized trial of MT versus no MT at the time of simulation included the pre-State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S Anxiety) questionnaire and Symptom Distress Thermometer (SDT). Patients randomized to MT received a consultation with a music therapist, during which music of the patients' choice to be played during simulation was selected. The no-MT patients did not receive the MT consultation, nor did they hear prerecorded music during simulation. Subsequent to the simulation, all patients repeated the STAI-S Anxiety questionnaire and the SDT. Results: Of the 78 patients enrolled (39 in MT group and 39 in no-MT group), 38 had breast cancer and 40 had head and neck cancer. The male-female ratio was 27:51. The overall mean pre- and post-simulation STAI-S scores were 38.7 (range, 20-60) and 35.2 (range, 20-72), respectively. The overall mean pre- and post-simulation SDT scores were 3.2 (range, 0-10) and 2.5 (range, 0-10), respectively. The MT group had mean pre- and post-simulation STAI-S scores of 39.1 and 31.0, respectively (P<.0001), and the mean SDT scores before and after simulation were 3.2 and 1.7, respectively (P<.0001). The no-MT group's mean pre- and post-simulation STAI-S scores were 38.3 and 39.5, respectively (P=.46), and the mean SDT scores were 3 and 3.2, respectively (P=.51). Conclusions: MT significantly lowered patient anxiety and distress during the simulation procedure on the basis of the STAI-S questionnaire and SDT. Incorporating culturally centered individualized MT may be an effective intervention to reduce stressors. Continued research defining the role of MT intervention in improving the patient experience by reducing anxiety is warranted."

      "The use of functional music in gait training termed rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and treadmill training (TT) have both been shown to be effective in stroke patients (SP). The combination of RAS and treadmill training (RAS-TT) has not been clinically evaluated to date. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of RAS-TT on functional gait in SP. The protocol followed the design of an explorative study with a rater-blinded three arm prospective randomized controlled parallel group design. Forty-five independently walking SP with a hemiparesis of the lower limb or an unsafe and asymmetrical walking pattern were recruited. RAS-TT was carried out over 4 weeks with TT and neurodevelopmental treatment based on Bobath approach (NDT) serving as control interventions. For RAS-TT functional music was adjusted individually while walking on the treadmill. Pre and post-assessments consisted of the fast gait speed test (FGS), a gait analysis with the locometre (LOC), 3 min walking time test (3MWT), and an instrumental evaluation of balance (IEB). Raters were blinded to group assignments. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with affiliated measures from pre-assessment and time between stroke and start of study as covariates. Thirty-five participants (mean age 63.6 ± 8.6 years, mean time between stroke and start of study 42.1 ± 23.7 days) completed the study (11 RAS-TT, 13 TT, 11 NDT). Significant group differences occurred in the FGS for adjusted post-measures in gait velocity [F (2, 34) = 3.864, p = 0.032; partial η2 = 0.205] and cadence [F (2, 34) = 7.656, p = 0.002; partial η2 = 0.338]. Group contrasts showed significantly higher values for RAS-TT. Stride length results did not vary between the groups. LOC, 3MWT, and IEB did not indicate group differences. One patient was withdrawn from TT because of pain in one arm. The study provides first evidence for a higher efficacy of RAS-TT in comparison to the standard approaches TT and NDT in restoring functional gait in SP. The results support the implementation of functional music in neurological gait rehabilitation and its use in combination with treadmill training.

      "Individuals with chronic stroke have limited options for hand rehabilitation at home. Here, we sought to determine the feasibility and efficacy of home-based MusicGlove therapy. Seventeen participants with moderate hand impairment in the chronic phase of stroke were randomized to 3 wk of home-based exercise with either the MusicGlove or conventional tabletop exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Box and Blocks test score from baseline to 1 mo posttreatment. Both groups significantly improved their Box and Blocks test score, but no significant difference was found between groups. The MusicGlove group did exhibit significantly greater improvements than the conventional exercise group in motor activity log quality of movement and amount of use scores 1 mo posttherapy (p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively). Participants significantly increased their use of MusicGlove over time, completing 466 gripping movements per day on average at study end. MusicGlove therapy was not superior to conventional tabletop exercises for the primary end point but was nevertheless feasible and led to a significantly greater increase in self-reported functional use and quality of movement of the impaired hand than conventional home exercises.

Different approaches and techniques with music are used in the stroke rehabilitation to improve motor and cognitive functions but also psychological outcomes. In this randomized controlled pilot trial, relational active music therapy approaches were tested in the post-acute phase of disease. Thirty-eight hospitalized patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke were recruited and allocated in two groups. The experimental group underwent the standard of care (physiotherapy and occupational therapy daily sessions) and relational active music therapy treatments. The control group underwent the standard of care only. Motor functions and psychological aspects were assessed before and after treatments. Music therapy process was also evaluated using a specific rating scale. All groups showed a positive trend in quality of life, functional and disability levels, and gross mobility. The experimental group showed a decrease of anxiety and, in particular, of depression (p = 0.016). In addition, the strength of non-dominant hand (grip) significantly increased in the experimental group (p = 0.041). Music therapy assessment showed a significant improvement over time of non-verbal and sonorous-music relationships. Future studies, including a greater number of patients and follow-up evaluations, are needed to confirm promising results of this study."

      "Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with neurodevelopmental disabilities could not attend their usual rehabilitation therapies, with a consequent reduced support of developmental process and risk of worsening of their clinical conditions. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 14 children with developmental delay, who had already tried a personalised music therapy (Euterpe method). We included them in a 12-day programme of home-based music therapy. The children and their parents were investigated using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Parent Stress Index-Short Form. Results: Fourteen children started the intervention, while only 12 children completed all the planned home sessions and assessments. We observed a significant improvement in children's sleep quality and a reduction of parental distress. Discussion: The significant improvements in parental distress and sleep quality must be considered important achievements for the quality of life of a child and their family. Home-based music therapy can provide a feasible approach to improving sleep and parent's stress for children with developmental disorders."

Likewise, they were instructed to move the dial to the word 'WAIT' when there was no music. They were also instructed to maintain the dial position for the duration of each music or silence excerpt. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences between the caregivers' and the college students' group means for total dial changes, correct and incorrect recognitions, correct and incorrect responses to silence excerpts, and reaction times. The mean scores of these 2 groups were combined and compared with the mean scores of the group of elderly adults with cognitive impairments. The mean total dial changes were significantly lower for the listeners with cognitive impairments, resulting in significant differences in all of the other response categories except incorrect recognitions. In addition, their mean absence of response to silence excerpts was significantly higher than their mean absence of responding to music excerpts. Their mean reaction time was significantly slower than the comparison group's reaction time. To evaluate training effects, 10 of the original 12 music therapy participants repeated the listening task with assistance from the therapist (treatment) immediately following the first listening (baseline). A week later the order was reversed for the 2 listening trials. Statistical and graphic analysis of responses between first and second baseline responses indicate significant improvement in responses to silence and music excerpts over the 2 sessions. Applications of the findings to music listening interventions for maintaining attention, eliciting social interaction between clients or caregivers and their patients, and evaluating this population's affective responses to music are discussed.",
      "Demographic aging is a worldwide phenomenon, cognitive and behavioral impairment is becoming global burden of nerve damage. However, the effect of pharmacological treatment is not satisfying. Therefore, we analyzed the efficacy of music therapy in elderly dementia patients, and if so, whether music therapy can be used as first-line non-pharmacological treatment. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, EMbase and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2016. A total of 34 studies (42 analyses, 1757 subjects) were included; all of them had an acceptable quality based on the PEDro and CASP scale scores. Studies based on any type of dementia patient were combined and analyzed by subgroup. The standardized mean difference was -0.42 (-0.74 to -0.11) for disruptive behavior and 0.20 (-0.09 to 0.49) for cognitive function as primary outcomes in random effect models using controls as the comparator; the secondary outcomes were depressive score, anxiety and quality of life. No evidence of publication bias was found based on Begg's and Egger's test. The meta-analysis confirmed that the baseline differences between the two groups were balanced. Subgroup analyses showed that disease sub-type, intervention method, comparator, subject location, trial design, trial period and outcome measure instrument made little difference in outcomes. The meta-regression may have identified the causes of heterogeneity as the intervention method, comparator and trial design. Music therapy was effective when patients received interactive therapy with a compared group. There was positive evidence to support the use of music therapy to treat disruptive behavior and anxiety; there were positive trends supporting the use of music therapy for the treatment of cognitive function, depression and quality of life. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016036153."
