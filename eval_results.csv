What are the benefits of music therapy for patients with autism spectrum disorder?,"['Improves communication skills', 'Enhances social interaction', 'Supports emotional regulation']","Music therapy has been shown to be beneficial for patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in several ways. It can significantly improve social skills, as evidenced by increased social skills scores in children with ASD. Additionally, music therapy can enhance joint attention behaviors and non-verbal social communication skills, such as eye contact and turn-taking. It also has a positive impact on verbal expressions, with certain interventions like singing associated with quicker vocal responses. Furthermore, music therapy can foster social and emotional competencies in adults with ASD, contributing to improved social competence and emotional skills. Overall, music therapy is an effective and well-accepted approach for enhancing various social and communication skills in individuals with ASD.","[""Title: Music therapy: An effective approach in improving social skills of children with autism\n\nAbstract: Background: The existing methodological weakness in conducted researches concerning music therapy (MT) for children with autism led to ambiguity and confusion in this scope of studies. The aim of the present research is to identify the effectiveness of MT method in improving social skills of children with autism and its stability, as well. Materials and methods: In the form of a clinical trial study with design of pretest/posttest/follow-up with control group, among the children with autism in community of Tehran city, on the basis of childhood autism rating scale, 27 children with mild to moderate autism were chosen and were divided into two groups of experiment (n = 13), and control (n = 14). Social skills' level of both groups was measured and recorded with the help of social skills rating system scale. The children of the experiment group participated in MT programs of Orff-Schulwerk for 45 days in 12 sessions (two sessions of 1-h/week), whereas the control group received no intervention. The data were analyzed with Statistic Package For Social Science (SPSS) software t-test and analysis of covariance was used to compare groups. Results: In posttest, the results of covariance analysis showed a significant increase in social skills' scores of the experiment group (P < 0.001). Also, results of the paired-sample t-test showed that the effectiveness of MT has been persistent up to the follow-up phase. Conclusions: The study showed that MT is an effective method with deep and consistent effects on improving social skills of children with autism."", 'Title: Effects of Three Music Therapy Interventions on the Verbal Expressions of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Combined Single-Subject Design\n\nAbstract: The specific aims of this research study were to (a) examine the differential effect of three different music interventions, namely the interactive music playing therapy (""music and singing""), interaction music singing therapy (""singing""), and receptive music therapy (""listening"") studying the varying latency periods in the response time it took 3-year-old children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to elicit the target word vocally; and (b) assess the index of happiness of children with ASD after the implementation of the three music interventions, which can, in turn, be used to influence their overall quality of life through this specific intervention.

Primary outcome variables were social and emotional competence, and secondary outcomes were challenging behavior and quality of life. A participation rate of 86% indicated practicability; high CSQ-8 scores (M = 30 of max. 32) indicated acceptability. Significant improvement was found in social competence compared to the control group and emotional competence in the pre-post self-assessment on the AutCom questionnaire.

Ten participants formed the therapy group, and 10 the control group. The groups were comparable on the standard neurological classification scheme Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and mental disorders requiring medication. Measurements were taken before therapy began (T1), and subsequently every 3 months (T2-T4). This battery included indicators of clinical depression and anxiety (Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), a self-acceptance scale (SESA) and a life quality assessment (Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis). In addition, data were collected on cognitive (MSFC) and functional (EDSS) parameters. Patients in the therapy group received 3 blocks of music therapy in single sessions over the course of the one year project (8 to 10 sessions respectively). The music therapy approach used for this study is based on the Nordoff Robbins approach (Nordoff & Robbins, 1977). There was no significant difference between the music therapy treatment group and the control group. However, the effect size statistics comparing both groups show a medium effect size on the scales measuring self esteem (d = 0.5423, r =.026), depression HAD-D (d = 0.63, r = 0.310) and anxiety HAD-A (d = 0.63, r = 0.310).

Intervention during early childhood could decrease ASD symptoms. We aimed to identify the most effective intervention based on cognitive, developmental, and behavioural approaches and the factors that impact the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing interventions for ASD in preschool-aged children. Electronic databases were searched for related articles with randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs published between 2001 to 2015. Outcome measures were communication, behavioural and cognitive skills, reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) compared to a control group.

Further studies detailing the changes resulting from the use of music therapy with Alzheimer patients are needed. Objectives: Determine the clinical improvement profile of Alzheimer patients who have undergone music therapy. Patients and methods: Forty-two patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease underwent music therapy for 6 weeks. The changes in results on the Mini-mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Barthel Index scores were studied. We also analysed whether or not these changes were influenced by the degree of dementia severity. Results: Significant improvement was observed in memory, orientation, depression and anxiety (HAD scale) in both mild and moderate cases; in anxiety (NPI scale) in mild cases; and in delirium, hallucinations, agitation, irritability, and language disorders in the group with moderate Alzheimer disease. The effect on cognitive measures was appreciable after only 4 music therapy sessions.

Can music therapy improve motor recovery in patients with stroke?,"['Supports rhythmic entrainment', 'Improves gait and motor coordination', 'Enhances rehabilitation outcomes']","Music therapy has been shown to have a positive impact on motor recovery in stroke patients. Various studies have demonstrated improvements in motor functions, such as upper-limb motor function and fine motor control, when music therapy is incorporated into rehabilitation programs. These improvements are observed through different approaches, including music-supported therapy and specialized music therapy techniques, which often involve instrument playing or sonification of movements. Additionally, music therapy can enhance mood and psychological outcomes, contributing to overall recovery.","[""Title: Music-supported motor training after stroke reveals no superiority of synchronization in group therapy\n\nAbstract: Background: Music-supported therapy has been shown to be an effective tool for rehabilitation of motor deficits after stroke. A unique feature of music performance is that it is inherently social: music can be played together in synchrony. Aim: The present study explored the potential of synchronized music playing during therapy, asking whether synchronized playing could improve fine motor rehabilitation and mood. Method: Twenty-eight patients in neurological early rehabilitation after stroke with no substantial previous musical training were included. Patients learned to play simple finger exercises and familiar children's songs on the piano for 10 sessions of half an hour. Patients first received three individual therapy sessions and then continued in pairs. The patient pairs were divided into two groups. Patients in one group played synchronously (together group) whereas the patients in the other group played one after the other (in-turn group). To assess fine motor skill recovery the patients performed standard clinical tests such as the nine-hole-pegboard test (9HPT) and index finger-tapping speed and regularity, and metronome-paced finger tapping. Patients' mood was established using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Both groups showed improvements in fine motor control. In metronome-paced finger tapping, patients in both groups improved significantly. Mood tests revealed reductions in depression and fatigue in both groups. During therapy, patients in the in-turn group rated their partner as more sympathetic than the together-group in a visual-analog scale. Conclusions: Our results suggest that music-supported stroke rehabilitation can improve fine motor control and mood not only individually but also in patient pairs. Patients who were playing in turn rather than simultaneously tended to reveal greater improvement in fine motor skill. We speculate that patients in the former group may benefit from the opportunity to learn from observation."", 'Title: Active music therapy approach for stroke patients in the post-acute rehabilitation\n\nAbstract: Guidelines in stroke rehabilitation recommend the use of a multidisciplinary approach.

Recently, many studies have demonstrated that MST improved the motor functions of post-stroke patients. However, the underlying mechanism for this effect is still unclear. It may result from repeated practice or repeated practice combined with musical stimulation. Currently, few studies have been designed to clarify this discrepancy. In this study, the application of ""mute"" musical instruments allowed for the study of music as an independent factor. Methods: Thirty-three post-stroke patients with no substantial previous musical training were included. Participants were assigned to either audible music group (MG) or mute music group (CG), permitting observation of music\'s independent effect. All subjects received the conventional rehabilitation treatments. Patients in MG (n = 15) received 20 extra sessions of audible musical instrument training over 4 weeks.

We present an innovative musical sonification therapy, especially designed to retrain patients' gross motor functions. Sonification should motivate patients and provide additional sensory input informing about relative limb position. Twenty-five stroke patients were included in a clinical pre-post study and took part in the sonification training. The patients' upper extremity functions, their psychological states, and their arm movement smoothness were assessed pre and post training. Patients were randomly assigned to either of two groups. Both groups received an average of 10 days (M = 9.88; SD = 2.03; 30 min/day) of musical sonification therapy [music group (MG)] or a sham sonification movement training [control group (CG)], respectively. The only difference between the two protocols was that in the CG no sound was played back during training. In the beginning, patients explored the acoustic effects of their arm movements in space. At the end of the training, the patients played simple melodies by coordinated arm movements. The 15 patients in the MG showed significantly reduced joint pain (F = 19.96, p < 0.001) in the Fugl-Meyer assessment after training. They also reported a trend to have improved hand function in the stroke impact scale as compared to the CG. Movement smoothness at day 1, day 5, and the last day of the intervention was compared in MG patients and found to be significantly better after the therapy. Taken together, musical sonification may be a promising therapy for motor impairments after stroke, but further research is required since estimated effect sizes point to moderate treatment outcomes.""]","[""Objective: Music-supported therapy (MST) is a new approach for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that MST improved the motor functions of post-stroke patients. However, the underlying mechanism for this effect is still unclear. It may result from repeated practice or repeated practice combined with musical stimulation. Currently, few studies have been designed to clarify this discrepancy. In this study, the application of 'mute' musical instruments allowed for the study of music as an independent factor. Methods: Thirty-three post-stroke patients with no substantial previous musical training were included. Participants were assigned to either audible music group (MG) or mute music group (CG), permitting observation of music's independent effect. All subjects received the conventional rehabilitation treatments. Patients in MG (n = 15) received 20 extra sessions of audible musical instrument training over 4 weeks. Patients in CG (n = 18) received 'mute' musical instrument training of the same protocol as that of MG. Wolf motor function test (WMFT) and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for upper limbs were utilised to evaluate motor functions of patients in both groups before and after the treatment. Three patients in CG dropped out. Results: All participants in both groups showed significant improvements in motor functions of upper limbs after 4 weeks' treatment. However, significant differences in the WMFT were found between the two groups (WMFT-quality: P = 0.025; WMFT-time: P = 0.037), but not in the FMA (P = 0.448). In short, all participants showed significant improvement after 4 weeks' treatment, but subjects in MG demonstrated greater improvement than those in CG. Discussion: This study supports that MST, when combined with conventional treatment, is effective for the recovery of motor skills in post-stroke patients. Additionally, it suggests that apart from the repetitive practices of MST, music may play a unique role in improving upper-limb motor function for post-stroke patients."", 'The use of functional music in gait training termed rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and treadmill training (TT) have both been shown to be effective in stroke patients (SP). The combination of RAS and treadmill training (RAS-TT) has not been clinically evaluated to date. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of RAS-TT on functional gait in SP. The protocol followed the design of an explorative study with a rater-blinded three arm prospective randomized controlled parallel group design. Forty-five independently walking SP with a hemiparesis of the lower limb or an unsafe and asymmetrical walking pattern were recruited. RAS-TT was carried out over 4 weeks with TT and neurodevelopmental treatment based on Bobath approach (NDT) serving as control interventions. For RAS-TT functional music was adjusted individually while walking on the treadmill. Pre and post-assessments consisted of the fast gait speed test (FGS), a gait analysis with the locometre (LOC), 3 min walking time test (3MWT), and an instrumental evaluation of balance (IEB). Raters were blinded to group assignments. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with affiliated measures from pre-assessment and time between stroke and start of study as covariates. Thirty-five participants (mean age 63.6 ± 8.6 years, mean time between stroke and start of study 42.1 ± 23.7 days) completed the study (11 RAS-TT, 13 TT, 11 NDT). Significant group differences occurred in the FGS for adjusted post-measures in gait velocity [F (2, 34) = 3.864, p = 0.032; partial η2 = 0.205] and cadence [F (2, 34) = 7.656, p = 0.002; partial η2 = 0.338]. Group contrasts showed significantly higher values for RAS-TT. Stride length results did not vary between the groups. LOC, 3MWT, and IEB did not indicate group differences. One patient was withdrawn from TT because of pain in one arm. The study provides first evidence for a higher efficacy of RAS-TT in comparison to the standard approaches TT and NDT in restoring functional gait in SP. The results support the implementation of functional music in neurological gait rehabilitation and its use in combination with treadmill training.

Here, we sought to determine the feasibility and efficacy of home-based MusicGlove therapy. Seventeen participants with moderate hand impairment in the chronic phase of stroke were randomized to 3 wk of home-based exercise with either the MusicGlove or conventional tabletop exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Box and Blocks test score from baseline to 1 mo posttreatment. Both groups significantly improved their Box and Blocks test score, but no significant difference was found between groups. The MusicGlove group did exhibit significantly greater improvements than the conventional exercise group in motor activity log quality of movement and amount of use scores 1 mo posttherapy (p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively). Participants significantly increased their use of MusicGlove over time, completing 466 gripping movements per day on average at study end. MusicGlove therapy was not superior to conventional tabletop exercises for the primary end point but was nevertheless feasible and led to a significantly greater increase in self-reported functional use and quality of movement of the impaired hand than conventional home exercises.

This study aimed to summarize the effectiveness of rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) for the treatment of motor function and balance ability in stroke through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: All studies were retrieved from six databases. The effects of RAS on stroke were determined using the following indicators: motor function including step length, step cadence, velocity, Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA); and balance ability including overall balance index (OBI) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The risk map of bias of the quality of the studies and the meta-analysis results of the indicators was prepared using RevMan 5.2 software. Results: A total of 1,363 abstracts were retrieved. Among them, 325 duplicate studies were eliminated, and 971 studies were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts. In addition, by downloading the full text for further reading and screening, 47 studies were excluded. A total of 22 studies were included in the systematic review, and 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Assessment of quality, based on the PEDro scale, two studies had low quality, three studies had excellent quality, and the other studies had good quality; based on the Cochrane Collaborative Network Bias Risk Assessment Scale. A total of 15 studies specifically explained the random methods used. Meanwhile, seven studies did not report random sequence generation. A total of 10 studies reported that the evaluation of experimental results was blinded. In the meta-analysis, the results of motor function [namely, velocity (SMD = 0.99, 95% CI (0.43, 1.55)), step length (SMD = 0.97, 95% CI (0.74, 1.20)), and step cadence (MD = 5.16, 95% CI (4.17, 6.14)), FMA (MD = 2.93, 95% CI (2.04, 3.83))], were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The results of balance ability [OBI (MD = -0.51, 95% CI (-0.86, -0.16)) and BBS (MD = 2.93, 95% CI (1.67, 4.20))], were also statistically significant (P < 0.01). Among all the outcome indicators, three indicators were included in more than 10 studies: these are step length, step cadence, and velocity. The results showed that the two sides of the funnel chart were asymmetrical, thus these results all showed heterogeneity. The GRADEpro GDT online tool was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for the outcome indicators in the included studies. Five outcome indicators were included, of which three were low-quality indicators and two were moderate-quality indicators. Conclusions: RAS could improve gait parameters, walking function, and balance ability of individuals with stroke. However, studies or samples of outcome indicators for balance ability of stroke patients is relatively insufficient, which also requires further research in the future. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021225102.', ""Background: Given the increasing evidence demonstrating the effects of rhythmic auditory cueing for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients, this synthesized analysis is needed in order to improve rehabilitative practice and maximize clinical effectiveness. Objective: This study aimed to systematically analyze the literature on rhythmic auditory cueing for motor rehabilitation of stroke patients by highlighting the outcome variables, type of cueing, and stage of stroke. Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled or clinically controlled trials was conducted. Electronic databases and music therapy journals were searched for studies including stroke, the use of rhythmic auditory cueing, and motor outcomes, such as gait and upper-extremity function. Results: A total of 10 studies (RCT or CCT) with 356 individuals were included for meta-analysis. There were large effect sizes (Hedges's g = 0.984 for walking velocity; Hedges's g = 0.840 for cadence; Hedges's g = 0.760 for stride length; and Hedges's g = 0.456 for Fugl-Meyer test scores) in the use of rhythmic auditory cueing. Additional subgroup analysis demonstrated that although the type of rhythmic cueing and stage of stroke did not lead to statistically substantial group differences, the effect sizes and heterogeneity values in each subgroup implied possible differences in treatment effect. Conclusions: This study corroborates the beneficial effects of rhythmic auditory cueing, supporting its expanded application to broadened areas of rehabilitation for stroke patients. Also, it suggests the future investigation of the differential outcomes depending on how rhythmic auditory cueing is provided in terms of type and intensity implemented.""]",1.0,1.0,0.7263213396072388,1.0,YES,1.0,YES
What role does music therapy play in reducing anxiety in cancer patients?,"['Provides relaxation', 'Reduces treatment-related stress', 'Improves emotional well-being']","Music therapy plays a significant role in reducing anxiety in cancer patients by providing a calming and therapeutic intervention that can alleviate anxiety symptoms associated with chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. It has been shown to effectively lower anxiety levels, improve emotional well-being, and enhance the overall quality of care for patients undergoing treatment. Music therapy can be tailored to individual needs, and its benefits are observed across various types of cancer, including breast cancer and lung cancer, as well as in different stages of treatment.","[""Title: A randomised controlled trial of the effect of music therapy and verbal relaxation on chemotherapy-induced anxiety\n\nAbstract: Aims: To determine the effect of music therapy and verbal relaxation on state anxiety and anxiety-induced physiological manifestations among patients with cancer before and after chemotherapy. Background: Cancer and its treatment provoke a series of changes in the emotional sphere of the patient's anxiety. Music therapy and verbal relaxation had reported the anxiety reduction effect on patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Few studies have been undertaken comparing music therapy and verbal relaxation in differentiating high-normal state anxiety subsample. Design: A randomised controlled trial and permuted block design were used. Outpatient chemotherapy clinic operated by a University medical centre in southern Taiwan. Methods: Ninety-eight patients were randomised into three groups: the music therapy group received one-hour single music session; the verbal relaxation group received 30 minutes of guided relaxation; the control group received usual care. Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Instrument, Emotional Visual Analog Scale, three biobehavioural indicators: skin temperature, heart rate and consciousness level were measured during and after chemotherapy. Result: Music therapy had a greater positive effect on postchemotherapy anxiety than verbal relaxation and control groups and a significantly increase in skin temperature. Patients with high state anxiety receiving music therapy had a greater drop in postchemotherapy anxiety than did the normal state anxiety subsample. Conclusions: Both music and verbal relaxation therapy are effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced anxiety. Thirty minutes of intervention initiates anxiety reduction. Patients with high state anxiety receiving chemotherapy obtain the most benefit from music or verbal relaxation. Relevance to clinical practice: Prior to chemotherapy, patients with high state anxiety must be sorted from all patients as they are more responsive to interventions. Oncology nurses can offer music and verbal relaxation as adjuvant interventions to reduce chemotherapy-induced anxiety and enhance the quality of care."", ""Title: Effects of music therapy on anxiety of patients with breast cancer after radical mastectomy: a randomized clinical trial\n\nAbstract: Aim: This paper is a report of a clinical trial of the effects of music therapy on anxiety of female breast cancer patients following radical mastectomy.

Results: Significant increases in Resilience Scale in MT groups after treatment with instrumental and vocal MT interventions equally potent-reflect average changes of 3.4 and 4.83 (P = 0.625), respectively. Although Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores showed little impact of MT on perceived anxiety/depression, a strong correlation is seen between vocal intervention and lower depression scores through Visual Analogue Scale-rendered postsessions. This yielded a significant decrease in pain levels immediately after MT, with the final session showing the most significant change in pain level.

The physiological role of this type of therapy is to stimulate the central nervous system through music, which may have a sedative, analgesic effect, and reduce negative emotions. Previous studies have confirmed that music can be effective for a range of psychological disorders, including post-stroke depression (PSD). There is, however, a lack of systematic evaluation of its effectiveness, and variability in sample size and in the quality of research has detracted from the persuasiveness of findings. Methods: Based on PRISMA 2020, articles on music therapy intervention in post-stroke depression were identified through the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Weipu, and Wanfang databases. The retrieval time was taken from the establishment of the database to October 18, 2022. Two researchers conducted a stringent evaluation of the quality of the articles and extracted the data. They then used RevMan5.3 software for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty articles were listed, involving 1625 patients. Meta-analysis results showed that music therapy could lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS/Ham-D), the National Institutes of Health stroke scale and self-rated depression scale for patients with PSD. Music therapy was also shown to improve the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living and treatment efficacy of PSD patients. However, music therapy did not reduce the incidence of adverse reactions in PSD patients. Conclusion: Music therapy has benefits in improving HDRS/Ham-D score and symptoms of PSD patients, and could be more widely applied.']",1.0,0.8571428571428571,0.647933840751648,1.0,YES,1.0,YES

Children with delayed speech development are more at risk of acquiring other cognitive, social-emotional, and school-related problems. Music therapy appears to facilitate speech development in children, even within a short period of time. The aim of this pilot study is to explore the effects of music therapy in children with delayed speech development. Methods: A total of 18 children aged 3.5 to 6 years with delayed speech development took part in this observational study in which music therapy and no treatment were compared to demonstrate effectiveness. Individual music therapy was provided on an outpatient basis. An ABAB reversal design with alternations between music therapy and no treatment with an interval of approximately eight weeks between the blocks was chosen. Before and after each study period, a speech development test, a non-verbal intelligence test for children, and music therapy assessment scales were used to evaluate the speech development of the children. Results: Compared to the baseline, we found a positive development in the study group after receiving music therapy. Both phonological capacity and the children's understanding of speech increased under treatment, as well as their cognitive structures, action patterns, and level of intelligence. Throughout the study period, developmental age converged with their biological age. Ratings according to the Nordoff-Robbins scales showed clinically significant changes in the children, namely in the areas of client-therapist relationship and communication. Conclusions: This study suggests that music therapy may have a measurable effect on the speech development of children through the treatment's interactions with fundamental aspects of speech development, including the ability to form and maintain relationships and prosodic abilities.

Literature suggests group music therapy might be beneficial in treating PTSD. However, feasibility and effectiveness have not been assessed. The study objectives were to assess whether group music therapy was feasible for patients who did not respond to CBT, and whether it has an effect on PTSD symptoms and depression. Design: The study employed mixed methods comprising of an exploratory randomized controlled trial, qualitative content analysis of therapy, and patient interviews. Method: Patients with significant PTSD symptoms (n = 17) following completion of CBT were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 9) or control groups (n = 8).

Neurological music therapy may aid these aspects of recovery. We performed a cross-over randomized controlled trial where 40 persons with moderate-severe TBI received a 3-month neurological music therapy intervention (2 times/week, 60 min/session), either during the first (AB, n = 20) or second (BA, n = 20) half of a 6-month follow-up period. The evidence from this RCT previously demonstrated that music therapy enhanced general EF and set shifting. In the current study, outcome was assessed with self-report and caregiver-report questionnaires performed at baseline, 3-month, 6-month, and 18-month stages. The results showed that the self-reported Behavioural Regulation Index of the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-A) improved more in the AB than BA group from baseline to 3-month stage and the effect was maintained in the 6-month follow-up. No changes in mood or quality of life questionnaires were observed. However, a qualitative content analysis of the feedback revealed that many participants experienced the intervention as helpful in terms of emotional well-being and activity.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of music therapy on mood, anxiety and depression in institutionalised patients with traumatic brain injury. Study methodology: A prospective, observational study. Materials and methods: Thirteen patients with traumatic brain injury were included in the present study and took part in individual, weekly, 1-hour music therapy sessions over a period of 20 weeks. Each session was divided into two 30-minute periods - one devoted to listening to music (receptive music therapy) and the other to playing an instrument (active music therapy). The assessment criteria (measured at weeks 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20) were mood (on the face scale) and anxiety-depression (on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression [HAD] Scale). Mood was assessed immediately before and after the first music therapy session and every fifth session. Results: Music therapy enabled a significant improvement in mood, from the first session onwards. This short-term effect was confirmed by the immediate changes in the scores after music therapy sessions (from 4.6+/-3.2 to 2.6+/-2; p<0.01). Music therapy also led to a significant reduction in anxiety-depression (p<0.05) from week 10 onwards and up until the end of the study (week 20). Conclusion: These results confirm the usefulness of music therapy in the treatment of anxiety-depression and mood in patients with traumatic brain injury. Music therapy could usefully form an integral part of the management programme for these patients.', 'Title: Use of preferred music to reduce emotional distress and symptom activity during radiation therapy\n\nAbstract: Music therapy has decreased anxiety levels in many medical settings. This randomized clinical trial examined the effectiveness of a music listening intervention, delivered by a board-certified music therapist, in patients undergoing curative radiation therapy (RT). Emotional distress (anxiety, depression, and treatment-related distress) and symptoms (fatigue and pain) were measured at baseline, mid-treatment, and end of treatment in 63 patients undergoing RT. Although patients who listened to self-selected music reported lower anxiety and treatment-related distress, there was a decline in these outcomes for patients in both groups over the course of RT. Depression, fatigue, and pain were not appreciably affected by music therapy. Within the music group, there was a significant correlation between number of times music was used/week and the change in treatment-related distress, suggesting that higher doses of music produced greater declines in distress. While these findings provided some support for the use of music in reducing distress during RT, further research demonstrating clear differences between intervention and control conditions is needed. Physical symptoms were not affected by the use of music over the course of RT.', ""Title: The effect of music therapy on physiological parameters of patients with traumatic brain injury: A triple-blind randomized controlled clinical trial\n\nAbstract: Objective: This study aims to investigate the effect of music therapy integrated with family recollection on physiological parameters of patients with traumatic brain injury who are admitted to Intensive Care Units.

The treatment group received 10 weeks of group music therapy after which exit interviews were conducted. Control group patients were offered the intervention at the end of the study. Symptoms were assessed on the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and Beck Depression Inventory II at the beginning and end of treatment. Results: Treatment-group patients experienced a significant reduction in severity of PTSD symptoms (-20.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-31.23, -9.12]) and a marginally significant reduction in depression (-11.92; 95%CI: [-24.05, 0.21]) at 10 weeks from baseline compared to the control. Patients viewed music therapy as helpful and reported experiences concur with current literature. Conclusions: Group music therapy appears feasible and effective for PTSD patients who have not sufficiently responded to CBT. Limitations include the small sample size and lack of blinding. Further research should address these limitations, test sustainability, and identify specific factors that address symptoms in treatment.', 'Studies report reductions in intrusive symptoms and emotional distress.']",1.0,0.5,0.6128038167953491,1.0,YES,1.0,YES
How does music therapy support respiratory function in patients with chronic lung disease?,"['Improves breathing control', 'Supports relaxation', 'Enhances exercise tolerance']","Music therapy can enhance respiratory function in patients with chronic lung disease by improving pulmonary parameters and providing psychological benefits. It can be integrated with pulmonary rehabilitation to help manage symptoms such as dyspnea and anxiety. Techniques such as singing, instrument playing, and music listening can aid in better expiratory volume control and adjustment of breathing patterns, contributing to improved lung function and overall well-being.","['Title: AIR: Advances in Respiration - Music therapy in the treatment of chronic pulmonary disease\n\nAbstract: The aim of this randomized control study is to examine the effect of a multimodal psycho-music therapy intervention on respiratory symptoms, psychological well-being and quality of life of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and other lung diseases as adjunct to Pulmonary Rehabilitation with a design of music therapy plus PR compared to Pulmonary Rehabilitation alone.

However, the effects of music therapy on dyspnea, anxiety, depression and other physiological parameters has not been elucidated. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of passive music therapy (listening to music) and mixed music (combination of listening and singing) in adults with COPD. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Wanfang Data up to June 26, 2019. All randomized controlled trials that compared music with usual care or other non-musical types of intervention in subjects with COPD were included in the study. The risk of bias for randomized controlled trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Outcomes included dyspnea, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and quality of life, as well as physiological parameters (eg, blood pressure and breathing frequency). Results: After initial screening of 216 potentially relevant records, 59 studies were eligible, and 12 studies with 812 participates met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. Analysis showed that music therapy had a significant effect in relieving dyspnea (mean difference: -0.69, 95% CI -0.80 to -0.58, P < .001) and anxiety (standardized mean difference: -1.87, 95% CI -2.72 to -1.02, P < .001) in adults with COPD. Compared with the control group, music had no statistically significant effect on depression or St George Respiratory Questionnaire score. However, when it came to improving sleep quality, music reduced the total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (P < .001).

It may also reduce chronic pain and improve quality of life and sleep after surgery. Overall, music therapy can be a valuable supplementary treatment in managing postoperative recovery and enhancing the rehabilitation process.","['Title: Effects of music therapy on health-related outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial\n\nAbstract: This study tested effectiveness of music therapy in improving health-related outcomes of cardiac rehabilitation patients. Using a randomized, controlled trial with follow-up, the study was conducted in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program in Ohio. Sixty-eight of 103 recruited patients, 30 to 80 years of age, completed the protocol through posttreatment. Physiological and psychological outcomes were measured. Cardiac rehabilitation patients were randomly assigned to cardiac rehabilitation only or to music therapy plus cardiac rehabilitation. Music therapy included musical experiences, counseling, and Music-Assisted Relaxation and Imagery. The null hypothesis of no differences in health-related outcomes between cardiac rehabilitation patients who experienced cardiac rehabilitation with and without music therapy was rejected due to changes in systolic blood pressure pre to post-treatment. Interpretation of changes at 4 months posttreatment in anxiety, general health, and social functioning are limited, due to small sample sizes at follow-up. Pre to post-music therapy session improvements were also reported. Findings suggest that some health-related outcomes may be affected positively by participation in music therapy in addition to cardiac rehabilitation.

Method: The primary outcome was QoL; secondary measures assessed social enrichment, self-esteem, spirituality and psychiatric symptoms. The 13-week intervention comprised singing familiar songs and composing original songs recorded in a professional studio. Qualitative data were generated from focus group interviews and song lyric analysis.

Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant difference between GMT and SC on QoL and spirituality. This was robust to different assumptions about missing data (listwise deletion, last observation carried forward or multiple imputation). Per-protocol analysis suggested greater benefit for those receiving more sessions.

Aim: The present study explored the potential of synchronized music playing during therapy, asking whether synchronized playing could improve fine motor rehabilitation and mood. Method: Twenty-eight patients in neurological early rehabilitation after stroke with no substantial previous musical training were included. Patients learned to play simple finger exercises and familiar children's songs on the piano for 10 sessions of half an hour. Patients first received three individual therapy sessions and then continued in pairs. The patient pairs were divided into two groups. Patients in one group played synchronously (together group) whereas the patients in the other group played one after the other (in-turn group). To assess fine motor skill recovery the patients performed standard clinical tests such as the nine-hole-pegboard test (9HPT) and index finger-tapping speed and regularity, and metronome-paced finger tapping. Patients' mood was established using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Both groups showed improvements in fine motor control. In metronome-paced finger tapping, patients in both groups improved significantly. Mood tests revealed reductions in depression and fatigue in both groups. During therapy, patients in the in-turn group rated their partner as more sympathetic than the together-group in a visual-analog scale. Conclusions: Our results suggest that music-supported stroke rehabilitation can improve fine motor control and mood not only individually but also in patient pairs. Patients who were playing in turn rather than simultaneously tended to reveal greater improvement in fine motor skill.

After 10 sessions of group music therapy, the groups showed statistically significant differences in psychiatric symptoms (p<.05) and depression status (p<.05). Conclusion: Group music therapy is an economical and easily implemented method of improving depression and psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.', ""Twelve older adults with cognitive impairments who were participants in weekly community-based group music therapy sessions, 6 older adults in an Alzheimer's caregivers' group, and 6 college student volunteers listened to a 3.5 minute prepared audiotape of instrumental excerpts of patriotic selections. The tape consisted of 7 excerpts ranging from 18 s to 34 s in duration. Each music excerpt was followed by a 7-9 s period of silence, a 'wait' excerpt. Listeners were instructed to move a Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI) to the name of the music excerpt depicted on the CRDI overlay when they heard a music excerpt. Likewise, they were instructed to move the dial to the word 'WAIT' when there was no music. They were also instructed to maintain the dial position for the duration of each music or silence excerpt. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences between the caregivers' and the college students' group means for total dial changes, correct and incorrect recognitions, correct and incorrect responses to silence excerpts, and reaction times. The mean scores of these 2 groups were combined and compared with the mean scores of the group of elderly adults with cognitive impairments. The mean total dial changes were significantly lower for the listeners with cognitive impairments, resulting in significant differences in all of the other response categories except incorrect recognitions. In addition, their mean absence of response to silence excerpts was significantly higher than their mean absence of responding to music excerpts. Their mean reaction time was significantly slower than the comparison group's reaction time. To evaluate training effects, 10 of the original 12 music therapy participants repeated the listening task with assistance from the therapist (treatment) immediately following the first listening (baseline). A week later the order was reversed for the 2 listening trials. Statistical and graphic analysis of responses between first and second baseline responses indicate significant improvement in responses to silence and music excerpts over the 2 sessions. Applications of the findings to music listening interventions for maintaining attention, eliciting social interaction between clients or caregivers and their patients, and evaluating this population's affective responses to music are discussed."", 'Objective: Music therapy is an innovative approach to support people with severe mental illness (SMI). The aim of the study was to determine whether group music therapy (GMT) positively impacted on quality of life (QoL), social enrichment, self-esteem, spirituality and psychiatric symptoms of participants with SMI and how they experienced the intervention. Method: The primary outcome was QoL; secondary measures assessed social enrichment, self-esteem, spirituality and psychiatric symptoms. The 13-week intervention comprised singing familiar songs and composing original songs recorded in a professional studio. Qualitative data were generated from focus group interviews and song lyric analysis. Results: Ninety-nine adults (57 female) were recruited, with an initial cohort (n = 75) randomized to either: weekly GMT followed by standard care (SC) or SC followed by GMT. Crossover occurred after 13 weeks. Measures were conducted at baseline, 13, 26 and 39 weeks. A second cohort (n = 24) could not be randomized and were assigned to GMT followed by SC. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant difference between GMT and SC on QoL and spirituality. This was robust to different assumptions about missing data (listwise deletion, last observation carried forward or multiple imputation). Per-protocol analysis suggested greater benefit for those receiving more sessions. Focus group interview and song lyric analyses suggested that GMT was enjoyable; self-esteem was enhanced; participants appreciated therapists and peers; and although challenges were experienced, the programme was recommended to others. Conclusion: Group music therapy may enhance QoL and spirituality of persons with SMI.', ""Objective: Schizophrenia is one of the most serious mental disorders.

Additionally, the experimental group (n = 21) underwent group music therapy. Results: Significant effects of music therapy are found in patients' self-evaluation of their psychosocial orientation and for negative symptoms. No differences were found in the quality of life.

Background: Present study was the first to perform a meta-analysis that included all the randomised controlled trials found in literature relating to music therapy for people with dementia over the past 15 years. Design: A meta-analysis study design. Methods: Quantitative studies were retrieved from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library Database, CINAHL, SCOPUS and PsycINFO. A meta-analysis was used to calculate the overall effect sizes of music therapy on outcome indicators. Results: Music therapy significantly improved disruptive behaviours [Hedges' g = -0·66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0·44 to -0·88] and anxiety levels (Hedges' g = -0·51; 95% CI = -0·02 to -1·00) in people with dementia. Music therapy might affect depressive moods (Hedges' g = -0·39; 95% CI = 0·01 to -0·78), and cognitive functioning (Hedges' g = 0·19; 95% CI = 0·45 to -0·08). Conclusion: Music therapy exerted a moderately large effect on disruptive behaviours of people with dementia, a moderate effect on anxiety levels and depressive moods, and a small effect on cognitive functioning. Relevance to clinical practice: Individual music therapy provided once a week to patients with cognitive functioning and manual guided in music intervention construction is suggested. Group music therapy is provided several times a week to reduce their disruptive behaviours, anxiety levels and depressive moods. Music therapy is a cost-effective, enjoyable, noninvasive therapy and could be useful for clinical nurses in creating an environment that is conducive to the well-being of patients with dementia.""]",1.0,1.0,0.5403210520744324,1.0,YES,1.0,YES
How do active (playing/singing) and receptive (listening) music therapy approaches differ in therapeutic effect?,"['Active engages participants in music-making', 'Receptive focuses on guided listening', 'Different effects on engagement and relaxation']","Active music therapy approaches, such as playing or singing, often involve direct participation and engagement in musical activities, which can lead to improvements in areas like verbal expression and self-esteem. These methods may be particularly effective in reducing latency in verbal responses and enhancing emotional experiences, as seen in children with autism spectrum disorder. On the other hand, receptive music therapy, which involves listening to music, can be effective in reducing anxiety and distress, as demonstrated in studies involving preoperative pediatric patients and tinnitus sufferers. While both approaches can lead to positive therapeutic outcomes, the specific effects may vary depending on the target population and the nature of the intervention.","['Title: Effects of music therapy on health-related outcomes in cardiac rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial\n\nAbstract: This study tested effectiveness of music therapy in improving health-related outcomes of cardiac rehabilitation patients. Using a randomized, controlled trial with follow-up, the study was conducted in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program in Ohio. Sixty-eight of 103 recruited patients, 30 to 80 years of age, completed the protocol through posttreatment. Physiological and psychological outcomes were measured. Cardiac rehabilitation patients were randomly assigned to cardiac rehabilitation only or to music therapy plus cardiac rehabilitation. Music therapy included musical experiences, counseling, and Music-Assisted Relaxation and Imagery. The null hypothesis of no differences in health-related outcomes between cardiac rehabilitation patients who experienced cardiac rehabilitation with and without music therapy was rejected due to changes in systolic blood pressure pre to post-treatment. Interpretation of changes at 4 months posttreatment in anxiety, general health, and social functioning are limited, due to small sample sizes at follow-up. Pre to post-music therapy session improvements were also reported. Findings suggest that some health-related outcomes may be affected positively by participation in music therapy in addition to cardiac rehabilitation.

Ten participants formed the therapy group, and 10 the control group. The groups were comparable on the standard neurological classification scheme Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and mental disorders requiring medication. Measurements were taken before therapy began (T1), and subsequently every 3 months (T2-T4). This battery included indicators of clinical depression and anxiety (Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), a self-acceptance scale (SESA) and a life quality assessment (Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis). In addition, data were collected on cognitive (MSFC) and functional (EDSS) parameters. Patients in the therapy group received 3 blocks of music therapy in single sessions over the course of the one year project (8 to 10 sessions respectively). The music therapy approach used for this study is based on the Nordoff Robbins approach (Nordoff & Robbins, 1977). There was no significant difference between the music therapy treatment group and the control group. However, the effect size statistics comparing both groups show a medium effect size on the scales measuring self esteem (d = 0.5423, r =.026), depression HAD-D (d = 0.63, r = 0.310) and anxiety HAD-A (d = 0.63, r = 0.310).

The neuroscientifically motivated Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy, previously developed by the German Center for Music Therapy Research, Heidelberg, Germany, was applied to explore its effects on individual distress and on brain structures. This therapy is a compact and fast application of nine consecutive 50-min sessions of individualized therapy implemented over 1 week. Clinical improvement and long-term effects over several years have previously been published. However, the underlying neural basis of the therapy's success has not yet been explored. In the current study, the therapy was applied to acute tinnitus patients (TG) and healthy active controls (AC). Non-treated patients were also included as passive controls (PTC). As predicted, the therapeutic intervention led to a significant decrease of tinnitus-related distress in TG compared to PTC. Before and after the study week, high-resolution MRT scans were obtained for each subject. Assessment by repeated measures design for several groups (Two-Way ANOVA) revealed structural gray matter (GM) increase in TG compared to PTC, comprising clusters in precuneus, medial superior frontal areas, and in the auditory cortex. This pattern was further applied as mask for general GM changes as induced by the therapy week. The therapy-like procedure in AC also elicited similar GM increases in precuneus and frontal regions. Comparison between structural effects in TG vs. AC was calculated within the mask for general GM changes to obtain specific effects in tinnitus patients, yielding GM increase in right Heschl's gyrus, right Rolandic operculum, and medial superior frontal regions. In line with recent findings on the crucial role of the auditory cortex in maintaining tinnitus-related distress, a causative relation between the therapy-related GM alterations in auditory areas and the long-lasting therapy effects can be assumed."", 'Title: Comparing Active and Passive Distraction-Based Music Therapy Interventions on Preoperative Anxiety in Pediatric Patients and Their Caregivers\n\nAbstract: Background: Young children who experience high levels of preoperative anxiety often exhibit distress behaviors, experience more surgical complications, and are at a higher risk for developing a variety of negative postoperative consequences. A significant factor in pediatric preoperative anxiety is the level of anxiety present in their caregivers. Active and passive music therapy interventions addressing anxiety prior to invasive procedures have been met with success. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the comparative effectiveness of two distraction-based music therapy interventions on reducing preoperative anxiety in young pediatric surgical patients and their caregivers. Methods: A total of 40 pediatric patient and caregiver dyads undergoing ambulatory surgery were included in this study. Pediatric preoperative anxiety was measured pre- and post-intervention using the modified Yale Pediatric Anxiety Scale, while caregiver anxiety was measured through self-report using the short-form Strait-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y6. Participants were randomized to either an active or passive intervention group for a preoperative music therapy session. Results: Results indicated a significant reduction in preoperative anxiety for both patients and their caregivers regardless of intervention type. Neither active nor passive music therapy interventions were significantly more effective than the other.

Hence, we designed a trial to determine whether patients with COPD would benefit from harmonica playing. COPD patients who completed pulmonary rehabilitation at least 6 months prior were eligible for this trial. Patients attended 12 weeks of harmonica training sessions for 2 hours a week and were encouraged to practice at home.

Additionally, 6-minute walk distance increased by approximately 60 m (61 ± 78, P = 0.03). This pilot study showed that a 12-week harmonica program significantly improved PImax, PEmax, and 6-minute walk distance in COPD patients after rehabilitation.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of music therapy on mood, anxiety and depression in institutionalised patients with traumatic brain injury. Study methodology: A prospective, observational study. Materials and methods: Thirteen patients with traumatic brain injury were included in the present study and took part in individual, weekly, 1-hour music therapy sessions over a period of 20 weeks. Each session was divided into two 30-minute periods - one devoted to listening to music (receptive music therapy) and the other to playing an instrument (active music therapy). The assessment criteria (measured at weeks 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20) were mood (on the face scale) and anxiety-depression (on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression [HAD] Scale). Mood was assessed immediately before and after the first music therapy session and every fifth session. Results: Music therapy enabled a significant improvement in mood, from the first session onwards. This short-term effect was confirmed by the immediate changes in the scores after music therapy sessions (from 4.6+/-3.2 to 2.6+/-2; p<0.01). Music therapy also led to a significant reduction in anxiety-depression (p<0.05) from week 10 onwards and up until the end of the study (week 20).

We hypothesized that live music therapy might improve vital signs during a physical therapy session. Seventeen children received live music therapy during the physical therapy session twice a week. Two more physical therapy sessions per week were held without music therapy. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were recorded from 15 min before to 15 min after the therapy sessions. Physical therapy interventions showed changes in heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation between, before and after the sessions with or without music therapy. Live music therapy was effective for the vital signs during the intervention. We observed significantly lower heart and respiratory rates and higher oxygen saturation during physical therapy intervention with live music therapy in general (mean differences -8.0 beats per min; -0.8 breaths per min and +0.6%). When physical therapy was applied without music therapy children's heart rates increased by 8.5 beats per min and respiratory rates increased by 1.0 breaths per min.

Results from several clinical trials support the notion that neuro-music therapy is an effective means to reduce tinnitus distress with short duration and long lasting effect. However, until now, the effectiveness has not been tested in a controlled trial against an active comparator. Methods: The trial was designed as two-center, parallel intervention group controlled study with two intervention groups: Counseling (50minute individualized personal instruction) or neuro-music therapy (counseling plus eight 50-minute sessions of individualized music therapy). Data of n=290 patients suffering from chronic tinnitus were analyzed. Outcome measure was the change in Tinnitus Questionnaire Total Scores (TQ) from baseline (admission) to end of treatment. Results: Both treatment groups achieved a statistically relevant reduction in TQ scores, though 66% of patients in the music therapy group attained a clinically meaningful improvement compared to 33% in the counseling group. A binary logistic regression revealed two variables significantly influencing therapy outcome: initial tinnitus score and type of therapy with an OR for the music therapy compared to the counseling of 4.34 (CI 2.33-8.09). Conclusions: Counseling is an appropriate treatment option with well above chance of improvement. The neuro-music therapy outperformed the counseling.

How does personalized playlist therapy compare with standardized session-based interventions?,"['Personalized playlists enhance patient engagement', 'Standardized sessions ensure consistency', 'Both have complementary benefits']","Personalized playlist therapy, which involves tailoring music selections to individual preferences or specific conditions, can offer significant benefits in terms of reducing distress and improving cognitive functions. For example, personalized music therapy has been shown to effectively reduce tinnitus distress and improve autobiographical memory recall in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. These tailored interventions can lead to clinically meaningful improvements sustained over time.

In contrast, standardized session-based interventions, such as group music therapy or algorithmically created music listening, may focus on broader objectives like reducing anxiety, stress, or improving social skills. While these interventions can also be effective, they may not provide the same level of individualized impact as personalized playlists. Standardized interventions can improve general outcomes like depression and anxiety, but the effects might vary more widely among participants due to the lack of personalization.

Overall, personalized playlist therapy tends to offer more targeted benefits by addressing specific individual needs, whereas standardized interventions may provide broader, yet less individualized, improvements across a group.","['Title: Investigating the Effects of a Personalized, Spectrally Altered Music-Based Sound Therapy on Treating Tinnitus: A Blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nAbstract: Objective: This blinded, randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of a personalized, spectrally altered music-based sound therapy over 12 months of use.

Methods: Ten AD patients (mean age 78.1 years) participated in music therapy using singing training once a week for 6 months (music therapy group). Each session was performed with professional musicians using karaoke and a unique voice training method (the YUBA Method). Before and after the intervention period, each patient was assessed by neuropsychological batteries, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while the patients sang familiar songs with a karaoke device. As the control group, another 10 AD patients were recruited (mean age 77.0 years), and neuropsychological assessments were performed twice with an interval of 6 months. Results: In the music therapy group, the time for completion of the Japanese Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices was significantly reduced (p = 0.026), and the results obtained from interviewing the patients' caregivers revealed a significant decrease in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (p = 0.042) and a prolongation of the patients' sleep time (p = 0.039). The fMRI study revealed increased activity in the right angular gyrus and the left lingual gyrus in the before-minus-after subtraction analysis of the music therapy intervention. Conclusion: Music therapy intervention using singing training may be useful for dementia patients by improving the neural efficacy of cognitive processing."", ""Music has been proven to have therapeutic potential in neurological disorders, especially Parkinson's disease (PD), since rhythmic auditory cueing can partially replace the progressive loss of rhythmicity and automaticity. Several reports have highlighted improvements in motor outcomes in PD patients undergoing music therapy, but only a few studies have evaluated non-motor outcomes, such as quality of life (QoL), which deteriorates with disease progression. The current pilot study aims to examine the effects of a multimodal rehabilitation program centered on physical therapy combined with listening to music on self-reported QoL in people with PD, compared to the same rehabilitation program alone. The study was conducted on patients with idiopathic PD who attended a specific rehabilitation program with a duration of 2.5 h daily for 14 days. The patients were divided into the study group (16 patients), who listened to background music during the rehabilitation program sessions, and the control group who did not listen to music during sessions. The patients were assessed using the self-report Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) at the beginning of the program and 1 month after its initiation. The patients in the study group registered greater improvements in five of the eight areas of life assessed by PDQ-39 compared to the control group. In conclusion, listening to music combined with a multimodal rehabilitation program centered on physical therapy may be beneficial for the patients' quality of life."", 'Objective: Notched music therapy has been suggested to be effective for relieving tinnitus. We have developed a smartphone application using tailor-made notched music for tinnitus patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of this smartphone application on reducing tinnitus. In addition, we investigated the predictive factors for tinnitus treatment outcome using this smartphone application. Methods: A total of 26 patients who were chronically distressed by tinnitus with a ≥18 Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score were recruited from March 2013 to March 2015 (National Clinical Trial (NCT) Identifier Number 01663467). Patients were instructed to listen to tailor-made notched music through our smartphone application for 30-60min per day and were prescribed Ginkgo biloba for 3 months. Treatment outcome was evaluated using the THI, a visual analogue scale that measures the effects of tinnitus in terms of loudness, noticeable time, annoyance, and disruption of daily life. Demographic data, including age, sex, duration of tinnitus, and pre-treatment scores on questionnaires such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were compared between the effective and non-effective groups according to the differences between their pre- and post-treatment THI scores. Results: Smartphone application-delivered notched music therapy and Ginko combined treatment improved the THI score from 33.9±18.9 to 23.1±15.2; the effect was particularly marked for the emotional score of the THI. Improvement in the THI score was positively correlated with the initial THI score (P=0.001, adjusted estimated value=0.49, 95% confidence interval=0.25-0.73). Conclusion: Chronic tinnitus patients who underwent smartphone application-delivered notched music therapy and Ginko combined treatment showed improved THI scores, particularly the emotional score of the THI. A smartphone application-delivered therapy and Ginko combined treatment may be more effective in tinnitus patients who have had a higher initial THI.', ""Background: Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound without external acoustic stimulation. Recent tinnitus research suggests a relationship between attention processes and tinnitus-related distress. It has been found that too much focus on tinnitus comes at the expense of the visual domain. The angular gyrus (AG) seems to play a crucial role in switching attention to the most salient stimulus. This study aims to evaluate the involvement of the AG during visual attention tasks in tinnitus sufferers treated with Heidelberg Neuro-Music Therapy (HNMT), an intervention that has been shown to reduce tinnitus-related distress. Methods: Thirty-three patients with chronic tinnitus, 45 patients with recent-onset tinnitus, and 35 healthy controls were tested. A fraction of these (21/21/22) were treated with the 'compact' version of the HNMT lasting 1 week with intense treatments, while non-treated participants were included as passive controls. Visual attention was evaluated during functional Magnet-Resonance Imaging (fMRI) by a visual Continous Performance Task (CPT) using letter-based alarm cues ('O' and 'X') appearing in a sequence of neutral letters, 'A' through 'H.' Participants were instructed to respond via button press only if the letter 'O' was followed by the letter 'X' (GO condition), but not to respond if a neutral letter appeared instead (NOGO condition). All participants underwent two fMRI sessions, before and after a 1-week study period. Results: The CPT results revealed a relationship between error rates and tinnitus duration at baseline whereby the occurrence of erroneous 'GO omissions' and the reaction time increased with tinnitus duration. Patients with chronic tinnitus who were treated with HNMT had decreasing error rates (fewer GO omissions) compared to treated recent-onset patients. fMRI analyses confirmed greater activation of the AG during CPT in chronic patients after HNMT treatment compared to treated recent-onset patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that HNMT treatment helps shift the attention from the auditory phantom percept toward visual cues in chronic tinnitus patients and that this shift in attention may involve the AG.""]",0.8,1.0,0.48746079206466675,1.0,YES,1.0,YES

Anxiety complicates the procedure as well as increases the risk of a complication. Listening to music was found to be the safest and most common non-drug treatment method. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of listening to music on adult patients in cast room procedures. This study points out the relation between anxiety and anxiety relevant cardiac arrhythmia. Materials and methods: The study was performed on 199 patients with stable general condition, aged above 18. The patients were divided into two groups. Randomization method used in the study was coin flip. The first group (Group 1) listened to music during cast room procedures whereby the second group (Group 2) did not listen to music.

How does tempo (BPM) influence relaxation in music therapy sessions?,"['Slower tempos promote relaxation', 'Faster tempos may increase arousal', 'BPM progression can guide therapy flow']","The tempo, or beats per minute (BPM), of music can significantly influence relaxation during music therapy sessions. Generally, slower tempos are associated with calming effects, helping to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. Music with a slower BPM can facilitate a decrease in heart rate and respiratory rate, contributing to a more relaxed state. Conversely, faster tempos may energize and stimulate, which might not be conducive to relaxation. Therefore, selecting music with an appropriate tempo is crucial in achieving the desired therapeutic outcomes in relaxation-focused music therapy sessions.","['Title: Comparing Three Music Therapy Interventions for Anxiety and Relaxation in Youth With Amplified Pain\n\nAbstract: Research in pediatric hospitals has shown that active music engagement, preferred music listening, and music-assisted relaxation can decrease anxiety and increase relaxation responses.

Music therapy included musical experiences, counseling, and Music-Assisted Relaxation and Imagery. The null hypothesis of no differences in health-related outcomes between cardiac rehabilitation patients who experienced cardiac rehabilitation with and without music therapy was rejected due to changes in systolic blood pressure pre to post-treatment. Interpretation of changes at 4 months posttreatment in anxiety, general health, and social functioning are limited, due to small sample sizes at follow-up.

The purpose of this study was to test the influences of music, as a nonpharmacologic adjuvant, in terms of significant changes for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) before, during, and after endodontic treatment in a population with different levels of anxiety assessed with the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. Methods: A total of 100 patients were recruited in the present study; before starting the endodontic treatment, the interviewer administered the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale to the participants to assess the baseline level of anxiety. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: the first one listened to the music and the second one did not. Before, during, and after the endodontic procedures, the vital signs (diastolic and systolic blood pressure and heart rate) were recorded. Results were collected and statistically analyzed. Results: Direct contrasts between patients listening or not listening to music showed that all the measured vital signs decreased considering the overall period (during and after the canal therapy) in the group of patients listening to music (P < .05). Conclusions: This study shows the effects of music therapy on vital values and on subjective perception of anxiety during endodontic therapy. Music and medicine always work together; the soothing effects of sounds and musical frequencies make this union an extraordinary tool of synergistic care. Music therapy is a valid nonpharmacologic adjuvant to anxiety perception in endodontic therapies.']","['Experimental studies confirm major keys are perceived as happier.', 'Minor key music may be beneficial in grief therapy.']",0.0,0.0,0.43686753511428833,1.0,YES,1.0,YES
Does cultural familiarity with music impact the effectiveness of therapy?,"['Familiar music increases engagement', 'Cultural relevance supports identity', 'Unfamiliar music may reduce efficacy']","The effectiveness of music therapy can be influenced by various factors, including cultural familiarity with the music used in the therapy sessions.

Results from several clinical trials support the notion that neuro-music therapy is an effective means to reduce tinnitus distress with short duration and long lasting effect. However, until now, the effectiveness has not been tested in a controlled trial against an active comparator. Methods: The trial was designed as two-center, parallel intervention group controlled study with two intervention groups: Counseling (50minute individualized personal instruction) or neuro-music therapy (counseling plus eight 50-minute sessions of individualized music therapy). Data of n=290 patients suffering from chronic tinnitus were analyzed. Outcome measure was the change in Tinnitus Questionnaire Total Scores (TQ) from baseline (admission) to end of treatment. Results: Both treatment groups achieved a statistically relevant reduction in TQ scores, though 66% of patients in the music therapy group attained a clinically meaningful improvement compared to 33% in the counseling group. A binary logistic regression revealed two variables significantly influencing therapy outcome: initial tinnitus score and type of therapy with an OR for the music therapy compared to the counseling of 4.34 (CI 2.33-8.09). Conclusions: Counseling is an appropriate treatment option with well above chance of improvement. The neuro-music therapy outperformed the counseling. This treatment targets the tinnitus sound itself, is short in duration, intrinsically motivating and easy to operate and thus presents a possible complement to the therapeutic spectrum in chronic tinnitus.

Ten participants formed the therapy group, and 10 the control group. The groups were comparable on the standard neurological classification scheme Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and mental disorders requiring medication. Measurements were taken before therapy began (T1), and subsequently every 3 months (T2-T4). This battery included indicators of clinical depression and anxiety (Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), a self-acceptance scale (SESA) and a life quality assessment (Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis). In addition, data were collected on cognitive (MSFC) and functional (EDSS) parameters. Patients in the therapy group received 3 blocks of music therapy in single sessions over the course of the one year project (8 to 10 sessions respectively). The music therapy approach used for this study is based on the Nordoff Robbins approach (Nordoff & Robbins, 1977).

Methods and materials: This institutional review board-approved randomized trial of MT versus no MT at the time of simulation included the pre-State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S Anxiety) questionnaire and Symptom Distress Thermometer (SDT). Patients randomized to MT received a consultation with a music therapist, during which music of the patients' choice to be played during simulation was selected.

How does rhythmic entrainment support motor rehabilitation in stroke patients?,"['Synchronizes movement with rhythm', 'Improves gait stability', 'Enhances neuroplasticity']","Rhythmic entrainment, often utilized in music therapy, supports motor rehabilitation in stroke patients by providing a structured auditory cue that can enhance motor function. This approach helps improve aspects such as step length, cadence, and velocity, contributing to better gait and balance. The rhythmic cues facilitate synchronization of movements, which can lead to improved motor control and coordination. Additionally, rhythmic entrainment can positively impact mood and motivation, further supporting the rehabilitation process.","[""Title: Music-supported motor training after stroke reveals no superiority of synchronization in group therapy\n\nAbstract: Background: Music-supported therapy has been shown to be an effective tool for rehabilitation of motor deficits after stroke. A unique feature of music performance is that it is inherently social: music can be played together in synchrony. Aim: The present study explored the potential of synchronized music playing during therapy, asking whether synchronized playing could improve fine motor rehabilitation and mood. Method: Twenty-eight patients in neurological early rehabilitation after stroke with no substantial previous musical training were included. Patients learned to play simple finger exercises and familiar children's songs on the piano for 10 sessions of half an hour. Patients first received three individual therapy sessions and then continued in pairs. The patient pairs were divided into two groups. Patients in one group played synchronously (together group) whereas the patients in the other group played one after the other (in-turn group). To assess fine motor skill recovery the patients performed standard clinical tests such as the nine-hole-pegboard test (9HPT) and index finger-tapping speed and regularity, and metronome-paced finger tapping. Patients' mood was established using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Both groups showed improvements in fine motor control. In metronome-paced finger tapping, patients in both groups improved significantly. Mood tests revealed reductions in depression and fatigue in both groups. During therapy, patients in the in-turn group rated their partner as more sympathetic than the together-group in a visual-analog scale. Conclusions: Our results suggest that music-supported stroke rehabilitation can improve fine motor control and mood not only individually but also in patient pairs. Patients who were playing in turn rather than simultaneously tended to reveal greater improvement in fine motor skill. We speculate that patients in the former group may benefit from the opportunity to learn from observation."", 'Title: Effects of rhythmic auditory stimulation on motor function and balance ability in stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical randomized controlled studies\n\nAbstract: Objective: Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) belongs to neurologic music therapy, which has attracted clinical attention because of its efficacy in motor function after stroke.

We present an innovative musical sonification therapy, especially designed to retrain patients' gross motor functions. Sonification should motivate patients and provide additional sensory input informing about relative limb position. Twenty-five stroke patients were included in a clinical pre-post study and took part in the sonification training. The patients' upper extremity functions, their psychological states, and their arm movement smoothness were assessed pre and post training. Patients were randomly assigned to either of two groups. Both groups received an average of 10 days (M = 9.88; SD = 2.03; 30 min/day) of musical sonification therapy [music group (MG)] or a sham sonification movement training [control group (CG)], respectively. The only difference between the two protocols was that in the CG no sound was played back during training. In the beginning, patients explored the acoustic effects of their arm movements in space. At the end of the training, the patients played simple melodies by coordinated arm movements. The 15 patients in the MG showed significantly reduced joint pain (F = 19.96, p < 0.001) in the Fugl-Meyer assessment after training. They also reported a trend to have improved hand function in the stroke impact scale as compared to the CG. Movement smoothness at day 1, day 5, and the last day of the intervention was compared in MG patients and found to be significantly better after the therapy.

The children and their parents were investigated using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Parent Stress Index-Short Form. Results: Fourteen children started the intervention, while only 12 children completed all the planned home sessions and assessments. We observed a significant improvement in children's sleep quality and a reduction of parental distress. Discussion: The significant improvements in parental distress and sleep quality must be considered important achievements for the quality of life of a child and their family. Home-based music therapy can provide a feasible approach to improving sleep and parent's stress for children with developmental disorders.""]",1.0,0.6,0.6066604852676392,1.0,YES,1.0,YES
What are the reported outcomes of music therapy in elderly populations?,"['Improves memory', 'Reduces loneliness', 'Supports mobility']","Music therapy in elderly populations has been reported to have several positive outcomes. It can decrease depression levels and lower systolic blood pressure in elderly individuals living in nursing homes. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, music therapy has shown improvements in cognitive, psychological, and behavioral aspects, including memory, orientation, depression, anxiety, and agitation. Additionally, music therapy has been effective in reducing agitated behavior in elderly persons with dementia, enhancing emotional relaxation, and fostering interpersonal interactions.","[""Title: The effect of music therapy on depression and physiological parameters in elderly people living in a Turkish nursing home: a randomized-controlled trial\n\nAbstract: Objective: This study was carried out in an effort to determine the effect of music therapy on depression and physiological parameters in elderly people who were living in a nursing home. Method: The study was a randomized controlled trial. The study sample consisted of 64 elderly people who complied with the criteria of inclusion for the study. The data were collected using the 'Elderly Information Form' and 'Geriatric Depression Scale'. The music group listened to music three days in a week during 8 weeks. The depression levels were assessed at baseline (week 0) and follow-up in the eight week. Results: It was found that the difference between post-test depression scores of the two groups was found to be statistically significant (t = -2.86, p <.01). The mean scores of post-test systolic blood pressure in the music group were found to be significantly lower than those of the control group (t = -3.11, p < .05). Conclusion: It was concluded that music therapy decreased the depression level and systolic blood pressure in elderly people. The study results implies that music therapy can be an effective practice for public health and home care nurses attempting to reduce depression and control physiological parameters of elderly people."", ""Title: Music therapy and Alzheimer's disease: Cognitive, psychological, and behavioural effects\n\nAbstract: Introduction: Music therapy is one of the types of active ageing programmes which are offered to elderly people. The usefulness of this programme in the field of dementia is beginning to be recognised by the scientific community, since studies have reported physical, cognitive, and psychological benefits. Further studies detailing the changes resulting from the use of music therapy with Alzheimer patients are needed. Objectives: Determine the clinical improvement profile of Alzheimer patients who have undergone music therapy. Patients and methods: Forty-two patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease underwent music therapy for 6 weeks. The changes in results on the Mini-mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Barthel Index scores were studied. We also analysed whether or not these changes were influenced by the degree of dementia severity. Results: Significant improvement was observed in memory, orientation, depression and anxiety (HAD scale) in both mild and moderate cases; in anxiety (NPI scale) in mild cases; and in delirium, hallucinations, agitation, irritability, and language disorders in the group with moderate Alzheimer disease. The effect on cognitive measures was appreciable after only 4 music therapy sessions. Conclusions: In the sample studied, music therapy improved some cognitive, psychological, and behavioural alterations in patients with Alzheimer disease. Combining music therapy with dance therapy to improve motor and functional impairment would be an interesting line of research."", ""Title: Music therapy in moderate and severe dementia of Alzheimer's type: a case-control study\n\nAbstract: Background: Music therapy is a potential non-pharmacological treatment for the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, but although some studies have found it to be helpful, most are small and uncontrolled. Methods: This case-control study was carried out by qualified music therapists in two nursing homes and two psychogeriatric wards. The participants were 38 patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) assigned randomly to a music therapy group and a control group. Results: The study showed a significant reduction in activity disturbances in the music therapy group during a 6-week period measured with the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD). There was also a significant reduction in the sum of scores of activity disturbances, aggressiveness and anxiety. Other symptoms rated by subscales of the BEHAVE-AD did not decrease significantly. Four weeks later the effects had mostly disappeared. Conclusions: Music therapy is a safe and effective method for treating agitation and anxiety in moderately severe and severe AD. This is in line with the results of some non-controlled studies on music therapy in dementia."", ""Title: Effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in patients with Alzheimer's type dementia: randomised, controlled study\n\nAbstract: Background/aims: Numerous studies have indicated the value of music therapy in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease. A recent pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of a new music therapy technique. The aim of this controlled, randomised study was to assess the effects of this new music therapy technique on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer-type dementia. Methods: This was a single-centre, comparative, controlled, randomised study, with blinded assessment of its results. The duration of follow-up was 24 weeks. The treated group (n = 15) participated in weekly sessions of individual, receptive music therapy. The musical style of the session was chosen by the patient. The validated 'U' technique was employed. The control group (n = 15) participated under the same conditions in reading sessions. The principal endpoint, measured at weeks 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24, was the level of anxiety (Hamilton Scale). Changes in the depression score (Geriatric Depression Scale) were also analyzed as a secondary endpoint. Results: Significant improvements in anxiety (p < 0.01) and depression (p < 0.01) were observed in the music therapy group as from week 4 and until week 16. The effect of music therapy was sustained for up to 8 weeks after the discontinuation of sessions between weeks 16 and 24 (p < 0.01). Conclusion: These results confirm the valuable effect of music therapy on anxiety and depression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. This new music therapy technique is simple to implement and can easily be integrated in a multidisciplinary programme for the management of Alzheimer's disease."", 'Title: Effectiveness of group music intervention against agitated behavior in elderly persons with dementia\n\nAbstract: Objectives: This study explored the effectiveness of group music intervention against agitated behavior in elderly persons with dementia. Methods: This was an experimental study using repeated measurements. Subjects were elderly persons who suffered from dementia and resided in nursing facilities. In total, 104 participants were recruited by permuted block randomization and of the 100 subjects who completed this study, 49 were in the experimental group and 51 were in the control group. The experimental group received a total of twelve 30-min group music intervention sessions, conducted twice a week for six consecutive weeks, while the control group participated in normal daily activities. In order to measure the effectiveness of the therapeutic sessions, assessments were conducted before the intervention, at the 6th and 12th group sessions, and at 1 month after cessation of the intervention. Longitudinal effects were analyzed by means of generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Results: After the group music therapy intervention, the experimental group showed better performance at the 6th and 12th sessions, and at 1 month after cessation of the intervention based on reductions in agitated behavior in general, physically non-aggressive behavior, verbally non-aggressive behavior, and physically aggressive behavior, while a reduction in verbally aggressive behavior was shown only at the 6th session. Conclusions: Group music intervention alleviated agitated behavior in elderly persons with dementia. We suggest that nursing facilities for demented elderly persons incorporate group music intervention in routine activities in order to enhance emotional relaxation, create inter-personal interactions, and reduce future agitated behaviors.']","['Elderly patients in nursing homes show improved mood with group singing.', 'Music interventions are associated with cognitive stimulation.', ""Previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of music therapy in Alzheimer's patients, focusing either on improvement of healthy cognitive and social skills, or reduction of agitation symptoms.

The tape consisted of 7 excerpts ranging from 18 s to 34 s in duration. Each music excerpt was followed by a 7-9 s period of silence, a 'wait' excerpt. Listeners were instructed to move a Continuous Response Digital Interface (CRDI) to the name of the music excerpt depicted on the CRDI overlay when they heard a music excerpt. Likewise, they were instructed to move the dial to the word 'WAIT' when there was no music. They were also instructed to maintain the dial position for the duration of each music or silence excerpt. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences between the caregivers' and the college students' group means for total dial changes, correct and incorrect recognitions, correct and incorrect responses to silence excerpts, and reaction times. The mean scores of these 2 groups were combined and compared with the mean scores of the group of elderly adults with cognitive impairments. The mean total dial changes were significantly lower for the listeners with cognitive impairments, resulting in significant differences in all of the other response categories except incorrect recognitions. In addition, their mean absence of response to silence excerpts was significantly higher than their mean absence of responding to music excerpts. Their mean reaction time was significantly slower than the comparison group's reaction time. To evaluate training effects, 10 of the original 12 music therapy participants repeated the listening task with assistance from the therapist (treatment) immediately following the first listening (baseline). A week later the order was reversed for the 2 listening trials. Statistical and graphic analysis of responses between first and second baseline responses indicate significant improvement in responses to silence and music excerpts over the 2 sessions.

A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, EMbase and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2016. A total of 34 studies (42 analyses, 1757 subjects) were included; all of them had an acceptable quality based on the PEDro and CASP scale scores. Studies based on any type of dementia patient were combined and analyzed by subgroup. The standardized mean difference was -0.42 (-0.74 to -0.11) for disruptive behavior and 0.20 (-0.09 to 0.49) for cognitive function as primary outcomes in random effect models using controls as the comparator; the secondary outcomes were depressive score, anxiety and quality of life. No evidence of publication bias was found based on Begg's and Egger's test. The meta-analysis confirmed that the baseline differences between the two groups were balanced. Subgroup analyses showed that disease sub-type, intervention method, comparator, subject location, trial design, trial period and outcome measure instrument made little difference in outcomes. The meta-regression may have identified the causes of heterogeneity as the intervention method, comparator and trial design.

Furthermore, objective and replicable measures are required from a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample size and an active comparable control."", ""Title: The additional therapeutic effect of group music therapy for schizophrenic patients: a randomized study\n\nAbstract: Objective: Schizophrenia is one of the most serious mental disorders. Music therapy has only recently been introduced as a form of treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of music therapy for schizophrenic in-patients needing acute care. Method: Thirty-seven patients with psychotic disorders were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. Both groups received medication and treatment indicated for their disorder. Additionally, the experimental group (n = 21) underwent group music therapy. Results: Significant effects of music therapy are found in patients' self-evaluation of their psychosocial orientation and for negative symptoms. No differences were found in the quality of life. Conclusion: Musical activity diminishes negative symptoms and improves interpersonal contact. These positive effects of music therapy could increase the patient's abilities to adapt to the social environment in the community after discharge from the hospital."", ""The three groups significantly differ in their scores in mental tension, negative emotion, positive emotion, cognitive functions, and self-esteem. All of these dimensions show the following pattern: music group>painting group>routine treatment group. Cross-group comparisons between the three groups are also statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: Traditional Chinese music therapy and painting therapy can promote the recovery of patients' physical and psychological functions. Traditional Chinese music intervention therapy is better than painting therapy and routine hospitalization in promoting the recovery of physical and psychological functions of hospitalized patients.""]","['Few RCTs have examined diverse ethnic groups.', 'Culturally adapted music therapy shows promising results.']",0.6,0.5,0.5724714398384094,,"Error code: 403 - {'error': {'message': '令牌额度不足本次预扣费 (request id: 2025092517232799355012464219286)', 'type': 'v_api_error', 'param': '', 'code': 'pre_consume_token_quota_failed'}}",,"Error code: 403 - {'error': {'message': '令牌额度不足本次预扣费 (request id: 2025092517232825194623762457396)', 'type': 'v_api_error', 'param': '', 'code': 'pre_consume_token_quota_failed'}}"
